 <title>Preparation for Application Operators</title>
 <para>
  Application operators who have booked a virtual machine in OpenStack can
  monitor their machine with libvirt. Libvirt provides a comprehensive toolkit
  for managing virtual machines. The toolkit includes checks for virtual
  machines that run on a hypervisor.
 </para>
 <para>
  As an OpenStack operator, you have to prepare the monitoring environment for
  your application operators. A Metrics Agent is required for monitoring the
  hypervisor on the Nova compute node on which the virtual machines are
  provisioned. On behalf of the application operator, the agent monitors the
  hypervisor on which it is installed as well as the provisioned virtual
  machines.
