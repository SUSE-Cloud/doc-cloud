Patch maintenance
-----------------
The document generation makes a few programmatic changes to the upstream
documentation in order to build successfully with SUSE theming, in the files
tox.ini, doc/requirements.txt, and doc/source/conf.gpy. Other changes to the
documentation are accomplished by maintaining patch files and applying them
during the build.  Whenever additional downstream modifications are necessary, a
new patch file needs to be created.  Use the following process to accomplish
this:

Generate the documentation, which applies the patch from this repo:
$ env PROJECTS={project} ./gen_docs.sh

Make and test document changes:
$ cd upstream/{project}

Iteratively:
 - Edit the document source under doc/source
 - Build the docs using:
       $ tox -e docs
 - View the built documents in a browser at:
       file:///...../doc-cloud/scripts/upstream/{project}/doc/build/html

When ready to generate the new patch file, first reset those files that the
script will programmatically modify:

$ git checkout tox.ini doc/requirements.txt doc/source/conf.py

Create the new patch file with
$ git diff > ../../patches/{projects}.patch

Commit it into git
$ cd ../..
$ git commit
