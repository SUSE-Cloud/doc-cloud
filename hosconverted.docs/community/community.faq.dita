<p>Customers have consistently asked us to release a distribution of OpenStack cloud, tested, hardened and supported by HP.</p>
<p>The final version of this free distribution will enable customers to evaluate HPE Helion OpenStack and to deploy small-scale private clouds in production (up to 30 nodes). They will be able to do this more quickly and easily with HP's simplified installation and update mechanisms.</p>
</section>
<section id="howcompare"> <title>How does HPE Helion OpenStack Community edition compare to other OpenStack cloud distributions on the market?</title>
<p>HPE Helion OpenStack Community edition is one of the first distributions in the market, based on up-to-date code from the OpenStack community. It is derived from pure OpenStack software and open source technologies, configured and packaged by HP. For example, TripleO, which is used for installation and update, is the official OpenStack project for deployment.</p>

</section>
<section id="TripleO"> <title>What is TripleO?</title>
<p>OpenStack on OpenStack or TripleO, is the OpenStack community's official project for deployment of OpenStack systems. It builds on the core resource-provisioning strengths of OpenStack technology. It enables you to administer your cloud, and deploy and maintain virtual and baremetal installations of the OpenStack platform using the same APIs you are familiar with for deploying workloads on an OpenStack cloud. A template-based deployment engine (using OpenStack Heat) allows for rigorous testing and reliable, repeatable deployments of known configurations.</p>
<p>A TripleO installation includes a seed, the undercloud, and the overcloud.</p>
</section>
<section id="preview"> <title>What is available in the current version?</title>
<p>On May 7<sup>th</sup>, we announced a virtual preview of HPE Helion OpenStack Community edition that allows our customers to deploy an OpenStack cloud-in-a-box on a single physical machine.

##Installing and Configuring the HPE Helion OpenStack Community edition



###Getting Started 

####What are the prerequisites for installing and configuring the HPE Helion OpenStack Community edition? #### {#prerequisites}

HPE Helion OpenStack Community edition is installed using TripleO, which uses three linked installation phases to deploy a complete OpenStack cloud. 

**Hardware Requirements**

TripleO creates several large VMs as part of the demo deployment process, hence it is essential to use a system that meets the following hardware specification:

* At least 16GB of RAM
* 64 bit Linux machine with at least 16GB of memory to act as the host of the seed VM.
* At least 200GB of available disk space
* Virtualization support, enabled in the BIOS

**Software System Preparation**

1. The following packages must be installed:
$ sudo apt-get install -y libvirt-bin openvswitch-switch openvswitch-common pythonlibvirt
qemu-system-x86 qemu-kvm
2. If you've just installed the libvirt packages above, you will need to restart libvirt:
$ sudo /etc/init.d/libvirt-bin restart
3. Ensure that the root user has a public key. Login as root:
$ sudo su -<br />
    Check whether .ssh/id_rsa exists:
    $ ls~root/.ssh/id_rsa
If the key does not exist, create one, omitting a passphrase (just hit return):
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa 

####How do I install the HPE Helion OpenStack Community edition, and what's included? #### {#HowdoIinstall}

1. Before you begin, remove the item re. creating a VM for the seed. This is done by the installer tool.
2. Login as root and unpack the tar file into root's home directory:
    $ sudo su -
    $ tar xvf <location-of-.tar.gz-file>

2. This will create and populate a tripleo/ directory within root's home directory.

3. Ensure that no LC_ variables are set:
$ env | grep ^LC_

4. If any variables are set, unset them using a blank export for each variable:
$ export <LC_VARIABLE_NAME>=

5. Start the seed VM:
$ HP_VM_MODE=y bash -x ~root/tripleo/tripleo-incubator/scripts/hp_ced_start_seed.sh

The process of starting the seed will take 5-10 minutes, or possibly longer depending on the capabilities of your system. There is currently a substantial amount of script/debug output that will be disabled in the final
customer version.

Allow the process to continue; you may need to ignore a password prompt for a few minutes, then just hit return until the seed setup continues.

Once the seed has completed its setup processing, you can proceed to the second stage, which is to deploy and configure the undercloud and overcloud, and to start a test guest VM in the overcloud compute node.

$ ssh 192.0.2.1 bash -x ~root/tripleo/tripleo-incubator/scripts/hp_ced_installer.sh

####What are the minimum and maximum number of configurations allowed? #### {#minimumandmaximumconfigs}

The minimum configuration is seven physical servers:

* One VM for the seed 
* One undercloud server
* Three overcloud management servers
* Two Swift object servers
* One compute Server

The maximum supported configuration is 36 servers. 

####How do I install and set up the HPE Helion OpenStack Community edition Admin Node? #### {#installandsetup}

It is recommended to install the Admin Node on a virtual machine only. 
Here are general guidelines for creating a virtual machine in an existing or new hypervisor infrastructure:

1. Configure the hypervisor host's network. The host must provide connectivity to the virtual machine Admin Node on an isolated private network 
to all the baremetal nodes' port eth0. And the virtual machine Admin Node must also have connectivity to a routable network for Internet access.

2. Create a virtual machine Admin Node with the suggested hardware configuration. The following configuration must be reviewed during this step:

    a. Ensure the virtual machine Admin Node's primary NIC is bridged or connected to the admin network and the second NIC is bridged or connected to a routable network for Internet access.

    b. For the disk configuration, the default Disk bus type/controller uses proprietary technology. Ensure you set that to the IDE/SCSI type.
 
    c. If your hypervisor is KVM, ensure the virt type is set to KVM.
 
3. Download the HPE Cloud OS ISO to the host's local file system or data store.

4. Configure the virtual machine Admin Node to point to the ISO as a CD/DVD drive or install media ISO image.

## Setting up the seed VM 

####What is a seed? #### {#Whatisseed}

The seed machine is a single node that is effectively just an installer.  Its sole purpose is to create the undercloud, and that is all.  This is the equivalent of your workstation, laptop, or maybe staff-shell (if you ever used it).  It uses nova, glance and heat to install the undercloud.

This is not a full OpenStack installation; it is a cut-down installation providing only the software required in order to enable the installation of the undercloud onto physical systems in the data center.

####How do I create a VM for the Seed based on the CloudOS specifications? #### {#createVM} 

####How do I load a under cloud image into the seed VM? #### {#imageseedcloud} 

####How do I log into the seed VM and deploy the undercloud? #### {#deployUC}   

### Setting up the undercloud and overcloud

####What is an undercloud? #### {#Whatisundercloud}

The undercloud is what you use as an administer to maintain the hardware.  It installs physical machines using nova and the baremetal or ironic driver (in the same way that it was installed from the seed). It then uses heat to deploy and configure the resulting booted systems, which is analogous to the use of Chef in HPE Public Cloud.  The sole purpose of the undercloud is to administer the physical machines in the data center for the purpose of making them run an OpenStack cloud.

This is not a full OpenStack installation, it is a cut-down installation providing only the software required in order to enable the installation of the overcloud onto physical systems in the data center.

####What is an overcloud? #### {#Whatisovercloud}

This is the HPE Public Cloud.  This is the OpenStack installation that you will interact with in the same way you interact with the HPE Public Cloud.  This is where the web interface will be housed, and the cloud in which all instances will be created/objects stored/volumes created etc.

This is a full and feature-rich OpenStack installation.

###Understanding how to use the Dashboard UI 

####How do I launch the HPE Helion OpenStack Community Dashboard? #### {#launchtheDashboard}

After you boot from the HPE Cloud OS ISO, you are ready to launch the Operational Dashboard to set up the Admin Node.

To launch the Operational Dashboard:

1. Get the IP address of your main control plane node via <b><font color="red"><yet to be defined process></font></b>
2. Open a web browser pointing to the IP address.
3. Log in as the 'admin' user using the admin password provided via <b><font color="red"><yet to be defined process></b>
pre-defined login creds: I cannot comment at this point. The admin password MAY be hard-coded into 
images provided, or MAY be randomly generated during install.
Note - don't refer to &#8220;ZIP&#8221;  files. I doubt we'll use the zip format.<.font></b>
