<p>HPE Helion OpenStack Networking is a virtual networking service that leverages the OpenStack Neutron service to provide network connectivity and addressing to HPE Helion OpenStack Compute service devices.</p>
<p>The Networking service also provides an API to configure and manage a variety of network services.</p>
<p>You can use the Networking service to connect guest servers or you can define and configure your own virtual network topology.</p>
<p>You can also use the Networking service to <xref type="section" href="#topic2579/nat">identify the actual IP address of a malicious user</xref>, if you know the user's NAT address.</p>
<section id="working-with-the-networking-service"> <title>Working with the Networking Service</title>
<p>To perform tasks using the Networking service, you can use the dashboard, API or CLI.</p>

<section id="API"> <title>Using the API<!--Removed anchor point API--><!-- id="API" --></title>
<p>You can use a low-level, raw REST API access to Networking. See the <xref href="http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref-networking-v2.html" scope="external" format="html" >OpenStack Compute API v2.0 Reference</xref>.</p>

<section id="cli"> <title>Using the CLI<!--Removed anchor point cli--><!-- id="cli" --></title>
<p>You can use any of several command-line interface software to access Networking. See the <xref href="http://docs.openstack.org/cli-reference/content/neutronclient_commands.html" scope="external" format="html" >OpenStack Command Line Interface Reference</xref>.</p>
<p>For more information on installing the CLI, see <xref href="http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/content/install_clients.html" scope="external" format="html" >Install the OpenStack command-line clients</xref>.</p>

## How To's with the HPE Helion OpenStack Networking Service ## {#howto}

The following lists of tasks can be performed by a user or administrator through the [HPE Helion OpenStack Dashboard](/helion/community/dashboard/how-works/), the OpenStack [CLI](http://docs.openstack.org/cli-reference/content/neutronclient_commands.html) or OpenStack [API](http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref-networking-v2.html).

The administrator can work with all projects in a domain. A user can only work with projects associated with that user.-->

<section id="nat"> <title>Tracking masked IP addresses when using network address translation (NAT)</title>
<p>If you know the NAT address of a malicious user, you can identify his actual IP address. HPE Helion OpenStack offers several methods to lookup the Networking Service VM associated with the source of the abusive network traffic.</p>
<p>For more information, see <xref href="../community/community.networking-maskedIP.xml" >Tracking masked IP addresses when using network address translation (NAT)</xref>.</p>
<!-- ### Working with networks ###

You can perform the following tasks:

- **Adding, modifying and removing a network** - Create, delete, and modify your network.
- **Adding, modifying and removing a port on your network** - Create, delete, and modify ports on your network.
- **Adding and removing a subnet to a network** - Create, delete, and modify subnets associated with your network, as needed.
- **Creating an external network** - Create an external network for your environment. Only an administrator can create an external network.

### Working with routers ###

You can perform the following tasks:

- **Adding and removing a network to a router** - Attach or detach a network to your router.
- **Adding, modifying or removing a router** - Add, modify or remove a router from your network.
- **Adding, modifying or removing an interface** - Add, modify or remove an interface from your router.
- **Adding and removing an external network to a router** - Attach or detach a router from an external network. -->

<section id="for-more-information"> <title>For more information</title>
<p>For information on how to operate your cloud we suggest you read the <xref href="http://docs.openstack.org/ops/" scope="external" format="html" >OpenStack Operations Guide</xref>. The <i>Architecture</i> section contains useful information about how an OpenStack Cloud is put together. However, the HPE Helion OpenStack takes care of these details for you. The <i>Operations</i> section contains information on how to manage the system.</p>
<!-- In GA aether only?
### Adding and removing a network to a DHCP agent ###

Use the Networking service to add or remove a network from a DHCP agent.

### Adding and removing a router to an L3 agent ###
