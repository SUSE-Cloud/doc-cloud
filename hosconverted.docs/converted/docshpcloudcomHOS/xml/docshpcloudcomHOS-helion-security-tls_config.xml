        the certificate is expired and generate your own by following the guidelines further down on

            of services. A CA certificate is used by the client to authenticate this claim. </para>

   <para>The major difference between an external VIP certificate and an internal VIP certificate is
        that the internal VIP has approximately 40 domain names in the SAN. This is because each
        service has a different domain name in <phrase/>. So it is
        unlikely that you can create an internal server certificate before running the configuration
        processor. But after a configuration processor run, a certificate request would be created
        for each of your cert-names.</para>

    
      <bridgehead renderas="sect4">Configuring TLS in the input model</bridgehead>
      <para>For this example certificate configuration, let's assume there's no FQDN for the external
        VIP and that you're going to use the default IP address provided by <phrase/>. Let's also assume that for the internal VIP you will use the
        defaults as well. If you were to call your certificate authority "example-CA," the CA
        certificate would then be called "example-CA.crt" and the key would be called
        "example-CA.key." In the following examples, the external VIP certificate will be named
        "example-public-cert" and the internal VIP certificate will be named
        "example-internal-cert."</para>

      <note>
         <para>Unless this is a new deployment, do not update both the certificate and

        has failed, rerun it with -vv to get detailed error information. The configure, HAproxy
        restart, and reconfigure steps are included below. If this is a new deployment and you are
        adding your own certs/CA before running site.yml this caveat does not apply.</para>

      </note>
      <para>You can add your own certificate by following the instructions below. All changes must go
        into the following file:</para>

      <screen>~/helion/my_cloud/definition/data/network_groups.yml</screen>
      <para>Below are the entries for TLS for the internal and admin load balancers:</para>

      <screen>- provider: ip-cluster
        name: lb
        tls-components:
        - default
        components:
        # These services do not currently support TLS so they are not listed 
        # under tls-components
        - nova-metadata
        roles:
        - internal
        - admin
        cert-file: helion-internal-cert
        # The helion-internal-cert is a reserved name and
        # this certificate will be autogenerated. You
        # can bring in your own certificate with a different name
        
        # cert-file: customer-provided-internal-cert
        # replace this with name of file in "config/tls/certs/"</screen>
      <para>The
      configuration processor will also create a request template for each named certificate under
        <literal>info/cert_reqs/</literal> This will be of the form:
      </para>

      <screen>info/cert_reqs/customer-provided-internal-cert</screen>
   
    <para>These request templates contain the subject <literal>Alt-names</literal> that the
      certificates need. You can add to this template before generating your certificate signing
      request .</para>

    <para>You would then send the CSR to your CA to be signed, and once you receive the
      certificate, place it in <literal>config/tls/certs</literal></para>

    <para> When you bring in your own certificate, you may want to bring in the trust chains (or
      CA certificate) for this certificate. This is usually not required if the CA is a public
      signer that is typically bundled with the operating system. However, we suggest you include it
      anyway by copying the file into the directory <literal>config/cacerts/</literal>.

      <para><phrase/> generates its own internal certificates but is designed to allow

            <para>You must have a server certificate and a CA certificate to go with it (unless the signer
          is a public CA and it's already bundled with most distributions). </para>

         </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>You must decide the names of the server certificates and configure the

            <para>Run the configuration processor. Note that you may or may not have the certificate file

          under <literal>info/cert_reqs/</literal> for each of the cert-name(s) in the
            <literal>network_groups.yml</literal> file. While there's no special reason to use the
          request file created for an external endpoint VIP certificate, it is important to use the
          request files created for internal certificates since the canonical names for the internal
          VIP can be many and service specific and each of these need to be in the Subject Alt Names
          attribute of the certificate. </para>

      <para>This section demonstrates to how you can create your own self-signed CA

      <para>In the case of a public VIP certificate, please add all the FQDNs you want it to support

        However, you can add it to the certificate request file manually. Here we assume that

      <para>Any attempt to use IP addresses rather than FQDNs in certificates must use subject

        signing CA's certificate (called CA certificate or trust chain) on the client machine, you
        are telling the client to trust this CA, and thereby implicitly trusting any server
        certificates that are signed by this CA, thus creating a trust anchor.</para>

      <screen>echo | openssl s_client -connect 192.168.245.9:5000 2&gt;/dev/null | grep code

Verify return code: 0 (ok) </screen>
      <para>Here,
      the first command produces error 21, which is then fixed by providing the CA certificate file.
      This verifies that the CA certificate matches the server certificate. </para>

   
    
      <bridgehead renderas="sect4">Turning TLS on or off</bridgehead>
      <para> You should leave TLS enabled in production.
      However, if you need to disable it for any reason, you must change "tls-components" to
      "components" in <literal>network_groups.yml</literal> (as shown earlier) and comment out the
      cert-file. Additionally, if you have a <literal>network_groups.yml</literal> file from a
      previous installation, you won't have TLS enabled unless you change "components" to
      "tls-components" in that file. By default, Horizon is configured with TLS in the input model.
      Note that you should not disable TLS in the input model for Horizon as that is a public
      endpoint and is required. Additionally, you should keep all services behind TLS, but using the
      input model file <literal>network_groups.yml</literal> you may turn TLS off for a service for
      troubleshooting or debugging. TLS should always be enabled for production environments.</para>

      <para>If
        you are using an example input model on a clean install, all supported TLS services will be
        enabled before deployment of your cloud. If you want to change this setting later, for
        example, when upgrading, you can change the input model and reconfigure the system. The
        process is as follows:</para>

      <para>Edit the input model <literal>network_groups.yml</literal> file
      appropriately, as described above. Then, commit the changes to the git
      repository:</para>

      <screen>cd ~/helion/hos/ansible/
