      <phrase/>Transport Layer Security (TLS)  Overview</title>
    





    <para>The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, successor to SSL, provides
        the mechanisms to ensure authentication, non-repudiation, confidentiality, and integrity of
        user communications to and between the <phrase/> services from internal and
        public endpoints.</para>
   <para>OpenStack endpoints are HTTP (REST) services providing APIs to other OpenStack services on
        the management network. All traffic to OpenStack services coming in on the public endpoints
        and some traffic between services can be secured using TLS connections. </para>
   <para>In  <phrase/>, the following are enabled for TLS</para>

         <para>API endpoints in the internal and admin VIPs can now be secured by TLS.</para>

        <listitem>
         <para>API endpoints can be provided with their own certificates (this is shown in the model
          examples) or they can simply use the default certificate.</para>

         <para>You can add multiple trust chains (certificate authority (CA) certificates).</para>

        <listitem>
         <para>Fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) can be used for public endpoints and now they can
          be changed. The ability to change the domain names was new in <phrase/>. The external name in the input model files (in
            <literal>~/helion/my_cloud/definition/data/network_groups.yml</literal>) is where the
          domain name is indicated and changed. </para>

         <para>There are two monitoring alarms specific to certificates, 14-days to certificate
          expiration and 1-day to expiration.</para>
