    <p>HPE Helion OpenStack allows you to manage the ESX hypervisor, manage the VMware vCenter, and
      provision virtual machines. This document provides installation instructions for HPE Helion
      OpenStack on a suitably specified and prepared system.</p>

        OpenStack<!--Removed anchor point install--><!-- id="install" --></title>
      <p>Make sure you have met all the hardware requirements and have completed the required tasks
        before you begin your installation. The following sections walk you through the steps to be
        executed on the seed cloud host:</p>
      <ul id="ul_b4c_y3n_vs">
        <li>Installing the seed
          VM</li>
        <li>Installing the undercloud and
            overcloud</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note that for ESX cloud deployments, the ESX administrator is responsible for providing the
        network connectivity between the ESX Network and the Helion Cloud Management Network as
        documented in prerequisite section of the <xref
          href="1.1commercial.install-GA-ESX-Proxy.xml">ESX Proxy page</xref>. Also read the
        information on the deployment of vCenter ESX Compute proxy on the same page.</p>
      <p>Since ESX/vCenter integration is not fully automatic, vCenter administrators are advised of
        the following responsibilities to ensure secure operation:</p>
      <ul id="ul_jsc_y3n_vs">
        <li> The VMware administrator is responsible for administration of the vCenter servers and
          the ESX nodes using the VMware administration tools. These responsibilities include: <ul
            id="ul_yzc_y3n_vs">
            <li>Installing and configuring vCenter Server</li>
            <li>Installing and configuring ESX server and ESX cluster</li>
            <li>Installing and configuring shared datastores</li>
            <li>Establishing network connectivity between the ESX network and the HPE Helion
              management network</li>
          </ul></li>
        <li>The VMware administration staff is responsible for the review of vCenter logs. These
          logs are not automatically included in Helion centralized logging.</li>
        <li>Logging levels for vCenter should be set appropriately to prevent logging of the
          password for the Helion message queue.</li>
        <li>The vCenter cluster and ESX Compute nodes must be appropriately backed up.</li>
        <li>Backup procedures for vCenter should ensure that the file containing the Helion
          configuration as part of Nova and Cinder volume services is backed up and the backups are
          protected appropriately.</li>
        <li>Since the file containing the Helion message queue password could appear in the swap
          area of a vCenter server, appropriate controls should be applied to the vCenter cluster to
          prevent discovery of the password via snooping of the swap area or memory dumps. </li>

      <title><b>Install the seed VM</b></title>
      <p>Follow the steps below to install the seed VM from the seed cloud host:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Make sure you are logged into the seed cloud host as root. If not:
          <codeblock><codeph>sudo -i</codeph>
          </codeblock></li>
        <li>Execute the esx-custom-ips.json (<xref
            href="1.1commercial.install-GA-JSON.xml#topic20151">explained here</xref>) file using
          the source command. The source command executes the content of the file passed as
          argument, in the current
          shell.<codeblock>source tripleo/tripleo-incubator/scripts/hp_ced_load_config.sh tripleo/configs/esx-custom-ips.json
</codeblock></li>
        <li>Start the seed VM installation by entering the following
              command:<codeblock>bash -x /root/tripleo/tripleo-incubator/scripts/hp_ced_host_manager.sh --create-seed |&amp; tee seedinstall.log
</codeblock><p><b>Note</b>:The
            installation process takes approximately 10 minutes to complete. The output will be
            recorded in a file named <i>seedinstall.log</i>.</p><p>When the seed VM startup is
            complete, you should see a message similar to the
              following:</p><codeblock>"Wed OCt 23 11:25:10 IST 2014 --- completed setup seed" 
</codeblock><p><b>Note:</b>
            If <codeblock>hp_ced_host_manager.sh</codeblock> fails to start the seed, restart the
            installation (step 1) and then follow the rest of the steps.</p></li>
      </ol>
    </section>
    <section id="pre"><b>Install the undercloud and overcloud </b></section>
    <section>
      <p>To install the undercloud and overcloud, execute the following steps, starting on the seed
        cloud host: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Upload the <xref href="1.1commercial.install-GA-CSV.xml#topic5926">baremetal.csv
            configuration file</xref> to /root on the seed
          VM.<codeblock>scp baremetal.csv root@&lt;ip_address&gt;:/baremetal.csv
</codeblock></li>
        <li>If you are integrating LDAP into your environment, copy the configuration files, as
          described in Integrating LDAP, to the seed VM.<p>a. Copy the overcloud_keystone_ldap.json
            file to the /root/tripleo/hp_passthrough folder like
            so:</p><codeblock>scp overcloud_keystone_ldap.json root@&lt;ip_address&gt;:/root/tripleo/hp_passthrough/overcloud_keystone_ldap.json
</codeblock><p>b.
            Place overcloud-env.json file (if created) into the /root/tripelo
          folder.</p><codeblock>scp overcloud-env.json root@&lt;ip_address&gt;:/root/tripleo/overcloud-env.json
</codeblock></li>
        <li>Connect to the seed VM:<codeblock>ssh root@&lt;seed_VM_IP_address&gt;
</codeblock><p>You
            can obtain the IP address of the seed VM from the /root/seedinstall.log
              file.</p><codeblock>cat seedinstall.log
BM_NETWORK_SEED_IP=192.0.2.1
</codeblock><p><b>Note</b>:
            It might take a few moments for the seed VM to become reachable. </p></li>
        <li>When prompted for host authentication, type <codeblock>yes</codeblock> to allow the SSH
          connection to proceed.<p>The prompt will change to
          <codeblock>root@hLinux</codeblock></p></li>
        <li><b>[Optional]</b> Use IPMItool to verify that network connectivity from the seed VM to
          the baremetal servers in your baremetal.csv file is
              working.<codeblock>/usr/bin/ipmitool -U &lt;ipmi_user&gt; -P &lt;ipmi_password&gt; -H &lt;ipmi_address&gt; -I lanplus power status
</codeblock><p><b>Example
              output:</b></p><codeblock>root@hLinux:# /usr/bin/ipmitool -U admin -P password -H 10.20.50.25 -I lanplus power status

Chassis Power is on.
</codeblock></li>
        <li>Use the IPMItool to manually power off each baremetal system specified in your
          baremetal.csv file before proceeding with the installation. <p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Make sure
            that each system is configured in the BIOS to stay powered off in the event of being
            shut down rather than automatically restarting.</p></li>
        <li>Set the environment variables for the undercloud and overcloud nodes listed in the
          esx-custom-ips.json file by executing the source command. The source command parses the
          json file and sets the environment variables listed there within the current
          shell.<codeblock>source tripleo/tripleo-incubator/scripts/hp_ced_load_config.sh tripleo/configs/esx-custom-ips.json 
</codeblock></li>
        <li>Install and configure the undercloud and overcloud by running the following command from
          /root.
            <codeblock>bash -x /root/tripleo/tripleo-incubator/scripts/hp_ced_installer.sh |&amp; tee cloud_install.log 
</codeblock><p>During this step, several important activities automatically occur:</p>
          <ol><li> The input data is processed and validated. 
For example:
<ul>
<li> Hardware details in baremetal.csv are validated, where possible</li>

  <li> Node assignments are checked</li>

  <li>IP address ranges are checked for validity</li>

  <li> NTP servers are validated</li>
</ul>
          </li>
            <li> The seed is customized and its OpenStack services are configured and started. The undercloud node is registered with the seed's ironic service</li>

<li> The undercloud is deployed, booted, and its heat stack is configured.
The undercloud OpenStack services are then configured and started.
The overcloud nodes are registered with the undercloud's ironic service.</li>

            <li> The overcloud controller heat stack is configured, booting and deploying images to the Overcloud Controller nodes and the SwiftStorage nodes.</li>

            <li> Booting and images are deployed to the individual stacks for the Overcloud compute and other nodes.</li>

            <li> Once all the overcloud heat stacks are configured, the overcloud is configured.</li>

            <li> Finally a demo VM is launched in the overcloud as a verification step.</li></ol>

Output messages will indicate when the undercloud and overcloud controllers become active, services are created and configured, and other aspects of the installation are executed. 
</li>
        <li>When the deployment completes, a message displays asking you to submit information on
          the install to HP. Enter Y to submit or any other key to not submit.<p>If your
            installation is successful, a message similar to the following is
              displayed:</p><codeblock>"HPE - completed - Tue Oct 23 16:20:20 UTC 2014"
</codeblock><p><b>Note:</b>
            If the installation does not complete properly, refer to the Troubleshooting
            document.</p></li>
      </ol>
      <p>If possible, leave this console display open as you will need the passwords to verify the
        installation. </p>
    </section>
    <p><b>Verify your installation</b></p>
    <p>To verify that the installation is successful, connect to the HPE Helion OpenStack dashboard
      and the undercloud dashboard as shown in<xref
        href="1.1commercial.install-GA-verify.xml#topic5033"> Verifying your
      installation</xref>.</p>
