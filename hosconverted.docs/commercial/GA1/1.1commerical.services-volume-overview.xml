<p>The HPE Helion OpenStack Block Storage Volume Operations uses the OpenStack Cinder (Block Storage) service to manage storage volumes, including creating volumes, creating volume snapshots, and configuring volumes.</p>
<p>Once created, you can easily disconnect block storage volumes from one instance and attach them to another. You can also create snapshots of these volumes.</p>
<p>HPE Helion OpenStack uses StoreVirtual as a backend to Cinder to realize horizontally scalable block storage. StoreVirtual is unique in the sense that the storage controller runs as a virtual appliance and helps realize Software Defined Block Storage. To use StoreVirtual you must use the KVM hypervisor.</p>
<p>HPE Helion OpenStack also supports HPE StoreServ 3PAR as a Cinder backend.</p>
