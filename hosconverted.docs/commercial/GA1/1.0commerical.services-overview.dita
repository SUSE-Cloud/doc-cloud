<p>OpenStack is comprised of several integrated services. Each service works through an API (application programming interface) that allows services to work together and allows users to interact with the services.</p>
<p>HPE Helion OpenStack includes a number of additional services to work with your cloud.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>In addition to the APIs, you can interact with the most services through a graphic user interface (dashboard or console) or a command line interface (CLI).</p>
<section id="service"> <title>Service User Accounts</title>
<p>The HPE Helion OpenStack installation process creates a <b>service</b> <b>user</b> account for each installed service. Service user accounts require elevated privileges to validate end user tokens. It is therefore strongly recommended that you do <b>
<i>not</i>
</b> add these service user accounts to any project because this could allow project users to access services they should not have permission to access.</p>
<p>The service user accounts include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Object Storage (Swift)</li>
<li>Nova</li>
<li>Neutron</li>
<li>Sherpa</li>
<li>Glance</li>
<li>Cinder</li>
<li>Heat</li>
<li>Keystone</li>
</ul>

<section id="OpenStack"> <title>OpenStack Services</title>
<p>The following services are foundation technologies used by the HPE Helion OpenStack Based on OpenStack technology, HPE Helion OpenStack comprises of a set of services and architecture that defines a data-center-level operating system (DCOS).</p>
<p>
<b>Compute Operations</b>. The Compute service manages the hypervisors and virtual machines in your environment. Also known as <b>Nova</b>.</p>
<p>See <xref href="1.0commerical.services-compute-overview.dita" >Overview of the Compute service</xref>.</p>
<p>
<b>Identity Management</b>. The Identity Management service enables you to create and administer users and security groups, and control access to your cloud environment. Also known as <b>Keystone</b>.</p>
<p>See <xref href="1.0commerical.services-identity-overview.dita" >Overview of the Identity Management service</xref>.</p>
<p>
<b>Image Operations</b>. The Image Operations service enables you to create and maintain server images, which you can use to launch virtual machines across the cloud. Also known as <b>Glance</b>.</p>
<p>See <xref href="1.0commerical.services-imaging-overview.dita" >Overview of the Image service</xref>.</p>
<p>
<b>Networking Operations</b>. The Networking service enables you to create and manage virtual networks. Also known as <b>Neutron</b>.</p>
<p>See <xref href="1.0commerical.services-networking-overview.dita" >Overview of the Networking service</xref>.</p>
<p>
<b>Object Operations</b>. The Object Operations service enables you to store and retrieve data. Object Storage is a distributed storage system for static data such as virtual machine images, photo storage, email storage, backups and archives. Also known as <b>Swift</b>.</p>
<p>See <xref href="1.0commerical.services-object-overview.dita" >Overview of the Object Operations service</xref>.</p>
<p>
<b>Orchestration</b>. The Orchestration service provides a template-based orchestration for describing a cloud application. A Heat template is a <xref href="http://www.yaml.org/" scope="external" format="html" >YAML</xref> file that describes the infrastructure for a cloud application. Templates contain vendor-independent specifications for launching a particular service or application.  Also known as <b>Heat</b>.</p>
<p>See <xref href="1.0commerical.services-orchestration-overview.dita" >Overview of the Orchestration service</xref>.</p>
<!---**Telemetry and Reporting**. The Telemetry and Reporting service enables a single infrastructure to collect measurements within your cloud environment.  Also known as **Ceilometer**.

See [Overview of the Telemetry and Reporting service](/helion/openstack/services/reporting/overview/).-->
<p>
<b>Volume Operations</b>. The Volume Operations service enables you to attach storage volumes to the virtual instances in your cloud environment. The service provides persistent block level storage devices for use with your Compute instances. Also known as <b>Cinder</b>.</p>
<p>See <xref href="1.0commerical.services-volume-overview.dita" >Overview of the Volume Operations Service</xref>.</p>

<section id="Dashboard"> <title>Dashboard Services</title>
<p>
<b>Horizon</b> The Horizon service is the basis of the <xref href="1.0commercial.dashboard.how-works.dita" >HPE Helion OpenStack dashboards</xref>. The dashboards are the web-based user interface for creating and managing HPE Helion OpenStack resources.</p>
<p>You can use the HPE Helion OpenStack dashboard to view, allocate, and manage all virtual resources within a cloud.</p>
<p>See <xref href="1.0commerical.services-horizon-overview.dita" >Overview of the Horizon Service</xref>.
<!-- Not in Commerical
**Loom**. The Loom service facilitates the comprehension and manipulation of complex systems using the Unity dashboard.

See [Overview of the Loom Service](/helion/openstack/services/loom/overview/).
