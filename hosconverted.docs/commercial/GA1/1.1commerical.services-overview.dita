<p>OpenStack is comprised of several integrated services. Each service works through an API (application programming interface) that allows services to work together and allows users to interact with the services.</p>
<p>HPE Helion OpenStack includes a number of additional services to work with your cloud.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>In addition to the APIs, you can interact with the most services through a graphic user interface (dashboard or console) or a command line interface (CLI).</p>
<section id="service"> <title>Service User Accounts</title>
<p>The HPE Helion OpenStack installation process creates a <b>service</b> <b>user</b> account for each installed service. Service user accounts require elevated privileges to validate end user tokens. It is therefore strongly recommended that you do <b>
<i>not</i>
</b> add these service user accounts to any project because this could allow project users to access services they should not have permission to access.</p>
<p>The service user accounts include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Object Storage (Swift)</li>
<li>Nova</li>
<li>Neutron</li>
<li>Sherpa</li>
<li>Glance</li>
<li>Cinder</li>
<li>Heat</li>
<li>Keystone</li>
<li>Ceilometer</li>
<li>Ceph</li>
