<p>HPE Helion OpenStack Object Storage includes two starter Swift All-in-One servers that are deployed by the initial installation. The installer auto-configures a portion of the first device recognized by the operating system and assigns it to the Swift entities (account, container and object rings).</p>
<p>It is recommended to use these Starter servers as host for the following Swift services for scaled out Swift cluster:</p>
<ol>
<li>Swift Proxy </li>
<li>Swift Account</li>
<li>Swift Container</li>
</ol>
<p>You can also use the ringos utility to add additional drives to Swift Account and Container rings. For more details, see the <xref href="../../commercial/GA1/1.1commerical.services-object-pyringos.dita" >ringos</xref> manual.</p>

<section id="storage-policies-and-policy-zero"> <title>Storage Policies and Policy Zero</title>
<p>For containers created before the deployment of scale-out Swift, default policy is policy-0.  Policy-0 is used to store objects. However, a new storage policy (termed as policy-1) is configured as soon as you deploy a scale-out Swift and it becomes the new default policy. After the deployment of scale-out Swift, all new containers are mapped to the new storage policy and  objects associated to those containers are stored in the ring with policy-1. For more details on storage policy, see <xref href="http://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/overview_policies.html" scope="external" format="html" >OpenStack Swift overview policies</xref>.</p>
<!--
All containers must have a storage policy. If a policy is not explicitly specified, the default policy is applied.

For legacy containers created prior to the implementation of storage policies, you can use *Policy-0*.

- **Policy- 0.** Each policy has both a friendly, configurable ***name*** as well as an ***index*** or number. The policy with index number zero (0) maps to the Ring-0, which is present by default in all installations, is Policy-0. 

    **Note:** You can change the name of Policy-0, but do not change the index, as there must always be a Policy-0. 

- **Default policy.** The ***default*** policy can be any policy defined in the cluster. The default policy is automatically chosen when a container is created without a storage policy specified.

In other words, default means *create the container using this policy if no policy was specified* and Policy-0 means *apply the legacy policy to an existing container that does not have a specified policy*. Note that in the unique case where no other policies are defined, Policy-0 is also the default. -->
