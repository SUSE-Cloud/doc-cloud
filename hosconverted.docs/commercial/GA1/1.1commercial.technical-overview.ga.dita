<!--

The physical machines need to have their management processors (iLO) connected to a network that is reachable from the Seed VM. The physical machines and the Seed VM need to be connected to a fast network.
We recommend using one physical Ethernet port on a 10 GB network. Use an untagged VLAN for this network. 

The Seed VM is expected to use eth0 to connect to the cluster network (and hence through to the management network). If your host uses another NIC, for example eth1, then you need to set the environment variable appropriately, for example BRIDGE_INTERFACE=eth1, as seen by root.

#### Network fabric 
* Two physical links, one for IPMI/iLO and one for the hypervisor/OS
* Network switches capable of basic VLAN, L2 and L3 functions (there is no dependency on VxLAN-capable or OpenFlow-enabled switch, although the product supports VxLAN as the virtual/overlay network)

The physical cluster network can be shared by a number of logical networks, each with its own tagged VLAN and IP subnet. We recommend using at least one such network as the external network, with floating IPs coming from its subnet range. -->

VMWare vCenter Compute driver is used as a part of ESX integration. The VMware vCenter driver connects to ESX clusters in a vCenter through Compute proxy nodes. A Compute node scheduler sees each cluster as compute and uses the same for scheduling a new instances.</p>
<p>An ESX Proxy Compute driver communicates to VMware vCenter server through VI SDK. All the details of vCenter in the Cloud Controller  are required to be captured. The EON service sub-component, captures details of the vCenter server in a Cloud Controller and provides the details of the clusters for configuring the list of clusters managed by ESX Proxy Compute node.</p>
<p>The ESX integration uses the OVSvApp application to connect the vCenter networking to the Network Operations controller to manage workload networks.</p>

<p>The HPE Helion OpenStack High Availability (HA) architecture ensures that cloud resources are always available on request, resulting in uninterrupted operations for users.</p>
<p>The OpenStack services are deployed in a three node Controller cluster, which ensures availability of stateless services like API services and stateful services like MySQL or RabbitMQ.</p>
<p>For more details on HA configuration, refer to <xref href="../../commercial/GA1/1.1commerical.high-availability.dita" >HPE Helion OpenStack High Availability</xref> and <xref href="http://docs.openstack.org/high-availability-guide/content/index.html" scope="external" format="html" >OpenStack HA Guide</xref>.</p>

<p>The following systems help you manage your cloud services.</p>
</section>
<section id="centralized-logging"> <title>Centralized Logging</title>
<p>Centralized logging is based on <xref href="http://logstash.net/" scope="external" format="html" >Logstash</xref>, <xref href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/" scope="external" format="html" >Elasticsearch</xref>, and <xref href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/kibana/current/_dashboard_schema.html" scope="external" format="html" >Kibana Dashboard</xref> which is deployed in the undercloud server.</p>
<p>Centralized logging helps the administrator triage and troubleshoot the distributed cloud deployment from the undercloud. The user is not required to access the several remote servers to view the individual log files.</p>
            <note> Logging requires 4GB of disk space to make sure that all logging messages are
                retained. <!-- CORE-1964 --></note>
</section>
<section id="monitoring"> <title>Monitoring</title>
<p>The monitor that is bundled with Helion is the Icinga service, which runs in the undercloud and helps cloud administrators monitor the disk usage of Swift storage node(s).</p>
<p>HPE Helion OpenStack allows you to monitor Swift clusters in any of the followings ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monitor Disk Usage and receive Disk Use Status Messages</li>
<li>Monitor Node Replication Status and receive Node Replication Status Messages</li>
<li>Monitor Service Health and receive Health Status Messages</li>
</ul>
<p>To monitor the other services, you must purchase additional software.</p>
<p>For more information on Icinga, see the <xref href="https://www.icinga.org/" scope="external" format="html" >Icinga Monitoring server</xref>. For more information on monitoring Swift disk usage in Helion, refer to  <xref href="../../commercial/GA1/1.1commerical.services-swift-deployment-monitor-swift-cluster.dita" >Swift Monitoring</xref>.
<!--
System and service health checks are based on the **check_mk** framework. Health checks are executed locally on each node, and their results are sent over to the central Icinga server, thereby distributing the processing and allowing the Icinga server to scale up. When new nodes are added to the cloud, they are automatically discovered and monitored.

<section id="add-remove-replace-nodes"> <title>Add, remove and replace nodes</title>
<p>HPE Helion OpenStack provides automation scripts to add capacity to the cloud for compute, storage, and networking.</p>
<p>You can prepare hardware servers and incrementally deploy HPE Compute nodes, HPE StoreVirtual VSA Block Storage nodes, and OpenStack Swift Proxy and Object Storage nodes.</p>
<p>Conversely, you can decommission servers and remove specific nodes from the cloud.</p>
<p>If any of the controller nodes fails, you can remove and replace controller nodes, while re-connecting them automatically into the HA cluster.</p>
<p>For more information refer to <xref href="../../commercial/GA1/1.1commerical.services-remove-replace-failed-overcloud-nodes.dita" >Removing and Replacing a Failed Overcloud Controller</xref>.</p>
<p>For more information on adding (Scale Out) or removing (Scale In) nodes (KVM Compute Nodes) to an already-installed overcloud on a KVM hypervisor, see <xref href="../../commercial/GA1/1.1commercial.install-add-nodes.dita" >HPE Helion OpenStack Add (Scale-Out) and Remove (Scale-In) Nodes on KVM Hypervisors</xref>.</p>
</section>
<section id="backup-restore-nodes"> <title>Backup and Restore nodes</title>
<p>Backup and restore scripts and procedures are provided for the seed VM, undercloud, overcloud management controller (running singleton services like Sherpa), and the MySQL database deployed in the controller cluster. These scripts are to be used by administrators managing the OpenStack Cloud.</p>
<p>Backup and Restore of VM instances/snapshots and volumes/snapshots for workloads in the cloud is supported using the Object Storage service.</p>
