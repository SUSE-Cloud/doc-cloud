<p>Before the HPE Helion OpenStack network can be installed, the Helion Network Administrator must complete, or verify have been completed, the tasks described in this section.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<xref type="section" href="#topic13492/select-hypervior">Select your hypervisor</xref>

<section id="select-hypervior"> <title>Select your hypervisor</title>
<p>Helion OpenStack supports both KVM and ESX hypervisors. Deployment requirements different depending on which platform you choose.</p>
<p>Before installing HPE Helion OpenStack you are responsible for preparing the network for all installations. You must also prepare the network based on the type of hypervisor you are installing, KVM or ESX.</p>
<p>The network is not installed or managed by the cloud. You must install and manage the network and make sure there is a route to the Management network as described in this section.</p>
</section>
<section id="preparing-all-networks"> <title>Preparing all networks</title>
<p>To ensure a successful installation, you must satisfy these network configuration requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The machine hosting the seed VM, and all baremetal systems have to be connected to a management network.</li>
<li>Nodes on this management network must be able to reach the iLO subsystem (<xref href="http://www8.hp.com/us/en/products/servers/ilo/index.html"   format="html" >HPE Integrated Lights-Out</xref>) of each baremetal systems to enable host reboots as part of the install process.</li>
<li>The Helion OpenStack architecture required that the IPMI network is a separate network and a route exists from management network to the IPMI network for iLO access as explained above.</li>
<li>Ensure network interfaces that are not used for PXE boot are disabled from BIOS to prevent PXE boot attempts from those devices.</li>
<li>If you have other DHCP servers on the same network as your system, you must ensure that the DHCP server does not hand out IP addresses to your physical nodes as they PXE boot.</li>
<li>The network interface intended as the bridge interface should be configured and working before running the installer. The installer creates a network bridge on the system running the installer, attaching the bridge interface to the network bridge. The installer uses the IP address of the bridge interface for the network bridge.</li>
<li>Configure Gratuitous ARP (GARP). When the tenant network is created, the Neutron L3 agents are responsible for sending GARP requests to detect IP conflicts and assist in refreshing the ARP cache of other nodes. If the external gateway already exists, the L3 agent also will trigger an update on iptables to insert NAT rules on the Network Node. Using this default behavior, Floating IPs are recycled among multiple VMs. Currently there is no OpenStack configuration variable to control the delay or interval between GARP transmits. It is therefore the responsibility of the network administrator to enable GARPs to pass through the gateways and control the GARP delays in the underlying physical network so as not to trigger a timeout.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to preparing all HPE Helion OpenStack cloud networks, you need perform additional tasks based on which hypervisor you are using: <xref href="../../../commercial/GA1/1.1commercial.install-GA-prereqs.xml" >KVM</xref> or <xref href="../../../commercial/GA1/1.1commercial.install-GA-prereqs.xml" >ESX</xref>.</p>
</section>
<section id="preparing-the-network-for-a-kvm-installation"> <title>Preparing the network for a KVM installation</title>
<p>If you are installing HPE Helion OpenStack with KVM hypervisor support, you must configure your network as shown in the following diagram.</p>
<p>
  <image href="../../../media/topology_kvm.png" placement="break"/>
</p>
<p>You are responsible for providing the internal and external customer router and making sure the external, IPMI, and service networks are routed to and from the management network.</p>
<p>
<b>Notes</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distributed Virtual Routing (DVR) is used to route traffic between VMs and outside the cloud. As such, every Compute Node has a connection to the external network.</li>
<li>Access to OpenStack service APIs is from the management network.</li>
<li>The network path for platform service log messages is from the VM, to the service network (installed as a second vNIC), to the Customer Router, to the management network, to the undercloud RabbitMQ, to LogStash.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="preparing-the-network-for-an-esx-installation"> <title>Preparing the network for an ESX installation</title>
<p>If you are installing HPE Helion OpenStack for ESX hypervisor support, you must configure your network as shown in the following diagram.</p>
<p>
  <image href="../../../media/topology_esxnew.png" placement="break"/>
</p>
</section>
<section id="installing-networks-for-esx"> <title>Installing networks for ESX</title>
<p>For ESX deployments, you must install and configure two specific networks:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ESX network. This network must be installed and configured for the VMware vCenter environment. The network is used for communication between specific aspects of vCenter:

<ul>
<li>the OVSvApp communicates with the Networking Operations service (Neutron) message queue</li>
<li>the Compute service communicates with the vCenter Proxy</li>
<li>the vCenter Proxy communicates with the message queue for the Compute and Volume Operations services.</li>
<li>the EON service sub-component communicates with the vCenter server.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li>installing and managing the ESX network and for assigning IP addresses on it to the OVSvApp and vCenter Proxy nodes;</li>
<li>providing a route for traffic between the Compute and Volume Operations services running on the vCenter Proxy node and the RabbitMQ and mySQL on the Cloud Controller:

<ul>
<li>The target IP addresses should be limited the IP addresses of the MySQL cluster nodes and RabbitMQ cluster nodes in the Over Cloud.   </li>
<li>The Port numbers shall be limited to 5672 (RabbitMQ) and 3306 (MySQL)</li>
</ul>

</ol>
</section>
<section id="envars"> <title>Editing the JSON Environment Variables File for Installation</title>
<p>To make the HPE Helion OpenStack installation process easier, you can enter all of the environment variables required by the installer into a JSON file that will be executed automatically. A JSON file is included in the installation package that you can modify with your environment variables.</p>
<p>For information on editing the JSON environment variables file, see <xref href="../../../commercial/GA1/1.1commercial.install-GA-JSON.xml" >Editing the JSON Environment Variables File for Installation</xref>.</p>
</section>
<section id="csv"> <title>Create the baremetal.csv file</title>
<p>During the installation process after the seed VM is installed, the installer script looks for information about the baremetal systems. Specifically, it looks for this information in a file called <codeph>baremetal.csv</codeph>. Before you begin the installation process, you must create this file and upload the file to the installer system (called the seed cloud host) at the appropriate installation step.</p>
<p>The baremetal.csv file informs the installer of the size of the Computer that each node will be installed into.</p>
<p>Specify the MAC address, CPU, memory, local disk size, IPMI address, and IPMI password values for each baremetal system you intend to install.</p>
<p>There must be one entry in this file for each baremetal system you intend to install.</p>
<p>
  <b>Notes:</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>The first line of the baremetal.csv file is the undercloud node. </li>
<li>The second line is what TripleO uses to construct the flavor for baremetal deployment. If your servers are not all the same size, specify the smallest sized server in the second position so it uses that size as the flavor for all of the overcloud nodes being deployed.The second entry must be the smallest sized disc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the following format in the <codeph>baremetal.csv</codeph> file.</p>
<p>
  <codeph>&lt;mac_address&gt;,&lt;ipmi_user&gt;,&lt;ipmi_password&gt;,&lt;ipmi_address&gt;,&lt;no_of_cpus&gt;,&lt;memory_MB&gt;,&lt;diskspace_GiB&gt;</codeph>
</p>
<p>Where <codeph>&lt;mac_address&gt;</codeph> is the MAC address of the network interface from which to boot. Do not use the iLO NIC interface.</p>
<p>
<b>Important</b> The diskspace size value must be specified in Gibibytes, not Gigabytes.  For example:<!--A BR tag was used here in the original source.-->
- 900GB = 838 GiB<!--A BR tag was used here in the original source.-->
- 1TB = 1000GB = 931 GiB</p>
<p>
  <b>Example:</b>
</p>
<p>Your file should look similar to the following:</p>
<codeblock>
  <codeph>78:e7:d1:22:5d:58,administrator,password,192.168.11.1,12,32768,1900
78:e7:d1:22:52:9b,administrator,password,192.168.11.6,12,16384,800
78:e7:d1:22:5d:10,administrator,password,192.168.11.5,12,32768,1900
78:e7:d1:22:52:90,administrator,password,192.168.11.3,12,32768,1900
78:e7:d1:22:5d:c0,administrator,password,192.168.11.2,12,32768,1900
78:e7:d1:22:5d:a8,administrator,password,192.168.11.4,12,32768,1900
78:e7:d1:22:52:9e,administrator,password,192.168.11.7,12,16384,800
</codeph>
</codeblock>
<p>When creating this file, keep in mind the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The IPMI user and password <b>must have</b> ADMINISTRATOR privilege; it is not sufficient to have OPERATOR privilege</li>
<li>Memory must be at least 32 GB</li>
<li>Disk size must be greater than 512GiB</li>
<li>The disk size specified should never exceed the physical disk size</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Important</b>: Make sure that the information specified is correct. If any node fails to install, you must restart the installation from the beginning.</p>
