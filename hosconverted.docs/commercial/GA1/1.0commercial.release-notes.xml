<p>
<b>Defect fixes</b> - A number of defects were addressed and fixed in this release.</p>
<p>
<b>Security documentation</b> - A new document is included in this release that contains recommendations for securing your HPE Helion OpenStack network. <xref href="1.0commercial.install-GA-security.dita" >Configuring your network securely</xref> details the firewall rules you can apply at the edge of the HPE Helion OpenStack deployment to protect against external abuse and defines router rules within the HPE Helion OpenStack deployment to protect against insider abuse or administrative errors.</p>
<p>
<b>HPE Helion OpenStack Flexible Control Plane</b> The <xref href="1.0commerical.flexible-control-pane-overview.dita" >HPE Helion OpenStack Flexible Control Plane</xref> introduces the capacity to deploy the control plane in a virtual environment in addition to the current baremetal physical deployment. This new configuration reduces the control plane footprint to just three servers from the current seven to ten servers.</p>

</section>
<section id="known-issues"> <title>Known Issues in this Release</title>
<p>The following are the known issues for HPE Helion OpenStack</p>
<p>
  <b>Installation Issues</b>
</p>
<p>When installing HPE Helion OpenStack you might experience the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a set of baremetal servers differ in specifications (such as memory or disk capacity), the installation fails. Specify the server with the lowest specs as the second entry in the <codeph>baremetal.csv</codeph> file. <!-- (CORE-1409) --></li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>Operational Issues</b>
</p>
<p>When using HPE Helion OpenStack you might experience the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A snapshot of an instance that was launched from a bootable volume might not boot. In addition, the Glance CLI and Horizon Dashboard might not report the snapshot properly. The snapshot will be listed as an image (not a snapshot) with a size of 0 and a blank disk format.</p>

<p>Even though with Horizon and CLI report the snapshot incorrectly,  the snapshot launches properly. <!-- (GLAN-1706) --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you use the Updates and Extensions tab of the Helion Dashboard for the overcloud (known as the <i>Sherpa UI</i>) to download two images that use the same name in two different projects, the second image will fail to upload to the Image Operations service (Glance). Avoid using images that use the same name. <!-- (C O D N-24) --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you determine that your VM seed has not started correctly when you execute the <codeph>hp_ced_start_seed</codeph> script, run the script a second time to ensure you start the seed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If, for some reason, the overcloud compute service is rebooted, the VMs might be in an ERROR state. Execute the following commands to restart the services and remove the error(s):</p>

<codeblock>
<codeph>$ sudo service nova-compute restart
$ sudo service nova-scheduler restart
$ sudo service nova-conductor restart
$ sudo service neutron-openvswitch-agent restart
</codeph>
</codeblock>
</li>
<li>
<p>In some instances, the centralized logging feature does not function after the  product installation. If this occurs, perform the following steps on the overcloud controller and all compute nodes:</p>

<codeblock>
<codeph>service rsyslog restart
</codeph>
</codeblock>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>Helion Dashboard</b>
</p>
<p>When using HPE Helion OpenStack you might experience the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On the <b>Floating IPs</b> tab in the Helion Dashboard (<b>Project &gt; Access &amp; Security &gt; Floating IPs</b>) all of the buttons (Associate, Disassociate, Release Floating IP) might not appear under certain circumstances. To make the buttons appear, first attempt to allocate a new floating IP. If the buttons are still not present, log out and log in as the same user.</p>

<p>To potentially avoid this issue, when creating users and projects, .  first create the project, then create user(s), and add those users to the project (rather than creating the user first, then creating a project).<!--(HORI-3110) --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Volume backups that are created in one project are accessible to all projects. In other projects, the information displayed might not be correct. Volume backups should not appear in other projects. There is no workaround. <!-- (HORI-3009) --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changing the user settings in a non-admin role affects all users across all projects. Changes to a user role should not affect other roles. There is no workaround. <!-- (HORI-2934) --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An admin is unable to retrieve object details in an Object Store. The admin might see a blank dialog box or receive the <i>Error: Unable to retrieve details.</i> error. Access object details as a non-admin user. <!-- (HORI-2930) --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An admin user will receive an error message <i>Error: Unable to retrieve user list.</i> while trying to access <b>Users</b> from the <b>Identity Panel</b>.  To wirk with users, an admin should use the CLI tools rather than the Horizon console. <!-- DOCS-723 --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An admin user in default domain is not able to edit Projects. <!--DOCS-727, DOCS-731 --></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>Other Issues</b>
</p>
<p>Other issues you might experience when using HPE Helion OpenStack</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If a project and user has been deleted, there is no way in the Helion Dashboard delete the networks associated with the project and user. To clean up artifacts created by a user account that has been deleted, use the CLI tools rather than the Horizon console. <!--(DOCS-733) --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you resize an instance of Nova, it produces an error <!--(NOV-6664) -->.</p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>After updating the undercloud to HPE Helion OpenStack 1.01, existing HPE StoreVirtual clusters might not work. The cluster is listed in the Helion Dashboard, but you might not be able to activate or unregister the cluster. If this occurs, you can <xref href="1.0commercial.undercloud-storage-storevirtual.dita#topic5728/register-cluster" type="section">manually register a new cluster</xref> with the same name and information as the non-working cluster. You should be able to activate the cluster. <!-- (ANSUPDATE-155) --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Kernel Panic error occurs when a user employs SSH to log in to a virtual machine and attempts to connect to an IP address external to HPE Helion OpenStack <!-- (EE-21) --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a controller node crashes, it must be rebooted to return to its operational state. <!-- (CORE-1387) --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Helion Core installation process leaves behind a shared private network defined. <!-- (CORE-586) --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a virtual IP address (VIP) is moved to a new controller, the OpenStack services stop responding to any CLI commands. The system will recover after several minutes. <!-- (CORE-1716) --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Compute service does not handle or recover from RabbitMQ Server process failure. <!-- (CORE-1559) --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The keepalived processes do not restart automatically when they are killed. Use the service <codeph>keepalived start</codeph> to restart keepalived. <!-- (CORE-972) --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The HAProxy does not automatically restart when it is killed. Restart haproxy manually using <codeph>service haproxy restart</codeph>. <!-- (CORE-943) --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A user can register but cannot update a vCenter through the UI.</p>
</li>
