<p>
<b>Integration with HPE ArcSight</b>
HPE Helion OpenStack through its centralized logging infrastructure (Logstash,) can be configured to send events and logs to an HPE ArcSight endpoint. The HPE ArcSight connector can, in turn, be configured to receive logs and events in real time from this Logstash configuration inside an HPE Helion OpenStack environment.</p>
<p>Integration with HPE ArcSight provides the ability to monitor, analyze, and correlate HPE Helion OpenStack logs through HPE ArcSight Logger and ESM and supports continuous security monitoring of the entire HPE Helion OpenStack infrastructure. Technical details of this integration along with a step-by-step tutorial are available in the whitepaper entitled <xref href="http://www8.hp.com/h20195/V2/GetDocument.aspx?docname=4AA5-8025ENW&amp;cc=us&amp;lc=en" scope="external" format="html" >Monitoring HPE Helion OpenStack with HPE ArcSight</xref>.</p>
<p>
<b>Enabled customer-provided certificates for all endpoints</b>

</section>
<section id="known-issues"> <title>Known Issues in this Release</title>
<p>The following are the known issues for HPE Helion OpenStack</p>
  
  
  <p>
    <b>Deployment Issues</b>
  </p>"Invalid Device Choice" error encountered while setting the persistent boot device.
  Deployment can fail on HPE Gen9 servers with iLO firmware version 2.2, with the following error
  in the conductor logs: "Invalid Device Choice" while setting the persistent boot device.
  <p>This error is caused by an issue in iLO firmware version 2.2 on HPE Gen9 servers. You have
    two options for working around this issue: <ol>
      <li> Manually install proliantutils version greater than or equal to 2.1.3 on the
        undercloud node. Run the following command on the undercloud node to install
        proliantutils: <codeblock>$ pip install "proliantutils>=2.1.3"</codeblock>
      </li>
      <li> Or switch to using iLO firmware version 2.1. </li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  
  
<p>
  <b>Operational Issues</b>
</p>
<p>When using HPE Helion OpenStack you might experience the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When a significant update operation is performed, such as adding or removing nodes, connectivity to the VM will drop until the operation is completed. This may last for up to 15 minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you use the Updates and Extensions tab of the Helion Dashboard for the overcloud (known as the <i>Sherpa UI</i>) to download two images that use the same name in two different projects, the second image will fail to upload to the Image Operations service (Glance). Avoid using images that use the same name. <!-- (CODN-24) --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If, for some reason, the overcloud compute service is rebooted, the VMs might be in an ERROR state. Execute the following commands to restart the services and remove the error(s):</p>

<codeblock>
<codeph>sudo service nova-compute restart
sudo service nova-scheduler restart
sudo service nova-conductor restart
sudo service neutron-openvswitch-agent restart
</codeph>
</codeblock>
</li>
<li>
<p>In some instances, the centralized logging feature does not function after the product installation. If this occurs, perform the following steps on the overcloud controller and all compute nodes:</p>

<codeblock>
<codeph>service beaver restart
</codeph>
</codeblock>
</li>
<li>The nova compute node with IP 10.23.32.210 may have processing issues, causing the check_mk agent responses to pause or hang. Multiple check processes can interfere with each other, which can lead to more delays. Kill all running check processes to work around the issue.
<!-- CORE-3174 --></li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>Networking Issues</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>After installation, VMs hosted on a particular compute host are not pingable. To resolve this issue, restart the Neutron-Open vSwitch-agent on that compute host.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under heavy load, the neutron-openvswitch-agent can fail to properly clean-up old virtual network interfaces resulting in degraded performance.  Restarting the neutron-openvswitch-agent can correct this problem. <!-- VNETCORE-490 DOCS-1062 --></p>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- Removed per Jack McCann
* When Distributed Virtual Router (DVR) is enabled, private IP address communication between instances on the same Neutron network is slower than public IP address communication. DVR speeds-up public IP address communication between instances on the same Neutron network, making private IP address communucation appear slower than public IP address communication. VNETCORE-441 DOCS-1063 
 -->
<p>
<!-- Removing this for 1.1.1 because it's fixed as of VNETCORE-448
* With Distributed Virtual Router (DVR) enabled, the performance of the `neutron router-interface-delete` command is known to degrade significantly as the number of routers or compute nodes increases.--> <!-- VNETCORE-448 DOCS-1061 --></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When creating very large numbers (thousands) of VM instances in a synchronous manner, sporadic instance creation failure may be experienced. To work around this behavior, lower the instance creation rate until consistent success is achieved. <!-- VNETEE-53 DOCS-1050 CORE-3042--></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a Nova compute node becomes unreachable, many openSSL requests are made to it, spawning many processes. The requests are not timed out or killed, causing resource usage to continue to increase. <!-- CORE-3174 --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Helion installer cannot handle spaces before or after IP addresses in kvm-custom-ips.json. As a result, the Helion installer cannot create the seed VM's networking.
<!-- DOCS-1317 and HLM-669 --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VMs scheduled on a particular host may not get their IP address in a timely manner. On that particular host, the neutron-openvswitch-agent process takes a large percentage of the CPU. Restarting the neutron services on that host will allow things to recover. <!-- Vnetcore-746 --></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>Helion Dashboard Issues</b>
</p>
<p>When using HPE Helion OpenStack you might experience the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You cannot associate floating IP to a nova instance port in the Horizon dashboard for users other than the admin user. By default, Horizon does not provide a "network" for any new user/tenant combo. The only way to get a network is to make an existing network a shared network. However there will be no router, because Horizon does not provide a mechanism to share the router, and thus there are no available ports listed.
The workaround is to associate/disassociate the floating IP from the CLI, like so: <!-- docs 1160 --> <!-- HORI-3315 --></p>

<codeblock>
<codeph>neutron floatingip-associate &lt;FLOATINGIP_ID&gt; &lt;PORT&gt;
</codeph>
</codeblock>

<p>Alternatively, from Horizon, create a router for the shared network and set the gateway to ext-net/public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changing the user settings in a non-admin role affects all users across all projects. Changes to a user role should not affect other roles. There is no workaround. <!-- (HORI-2934) --></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>Update Issues</b>
</p>
<p>You may experience the following issues when performing updates in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Depending on configuration, an overcloud update may take longer than was the case in earlier releases. 
<!--ANSUPDATE-276/DOCS-1070 --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After an update, the node removal procedure might not work.  This is a known issue.<!-- CORE-2940 / DOCS 1068  --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overcloud updates may fail because you cannot stop VSA VMs. Overcloud updates require that all VMs be stopped before an update can proceed. During an overcloud update, you may find that you are not able to stop the VSA VM (by issuing a <codeph>virsh stop</codeph> command). This causes the update to stop.</p>

<p>To fix this problem you can use the VSA command-line interface (CLIQ) to shut down VSA on the VM that cannot be shut down. You can access CLIQ by running ssh to port 16022 on the Virtual IP for the VSA server. If you do not know the IP address/username/password of the VSA system, you can find it in <b>/etc/cinder/cinder.conf</b> on controller0 on the overcloud.</p>

<codeblock>
<codeph>ssh -l &lt;username&gt; &lt;IP&gt; -p 16022
ClIQ&gt; shutdownNsm action=Shutdown
</codeph>
</codeblock>

<p>Proceed with the update.
<!--CORE 2981 / DOCS 1067--></p>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- Cinder cannot create volumes after a system update.   A resolution is under development. per DOCS 1182  -->
<p>
<!-- Cinder fails to create Bootable Volumes after a system update. It appears that ISCSI authentication is failing on controller0. The workaround is to migrate the `cinder-volume` service to another node, for example, controller1, and to stop the `cinder-backup` service on controller0.
Performing backups and creating bootable volumes will then work.-->   <!--CORE-2987 / DOCS 1064--></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cinder might fail after an update. To fix Cinder,  restart the <codeph>cinder-volume</codeph> service on controller0 by entering: <!-- DOCS-1047 --></p>

<codeblock>
<codeph>$ sudo service cinder-volume restart
</codeph>
</codeblock>

<p>Then restart the <codeph>cinder-backup</codeph> service on all three overcloud controller nodes by entering:</p>

<codeblock>
<codeph>$ sudo service cinder-backup restart
</codeph>
</codeblock>

  <p>For more information on how to restart the singleton Cinder volume  service, see <xref href="1.0commerical.high-availability.dita#topic21283/cinder-volume" type="section">HPE Helion OpenStack 1.1: High Availability</xref>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<!--DOCS-1032--> Cinder backup and create bootable volume functions fail after an update. A workaround exists if this is an ISCSI error.  To determine if this is an ISCSI error, grep for the following string in in <codeph>/var/log/cinder/cinder-volume.log</codeph> on controller0:</p>

<codeblock>
<codeph>grep 'Failed to copy image &lt;image-id&gt; to volume: &lt;volume-id&gt;, error: iscsiadm: No session found.' /var/log/cinder/cinder-volume.log
</codeph>
</codeblock>

<p>If this is an ISCSI error, you will see confirmation in the return, for example:</p>

<codeblock>
<codeph> 2015-02-23 13:46:01.415 21650 ERROR cinder.volume.flows.manager.create_volume [req-918f993f-5456-4eba-a266-67a638e9aa99 9f5ec59efa57483aad14b20378091195 c4b1111b613c4454a4cb3101ac420f54 - - -] Failed to copy image eeecc4aa-8a99-447d-848f-c40f4af0d606 to volume: 0260a9e1-2e4a-444f-81d7-867f63f23fe9, error: iscsiadm: No session found.
</codeph>
</codeblock>

<p>If you confirm that the error is present on Controller0, then the workaround is to:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>migrate the cinder-volume service to another node, for example, controller1 (refer to <xref href="1.0commerical.high-availability.dita#cinder-volume" type="section">HPE Helion OpenStack 1.1: High Availability</xref>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>stop the cinder-backup service on controller0 using</p>

<codeblock>
<codeph>sudo service cinder-backup stop
</codeph>
</codeblock>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Performing backups and creating bootable volumes will then work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>Other Issues</b>
</p>
<p>Other issues you might experience when using HPE Helion OpenStack</p>
<!-- (DOCS-839) -->
<ul>
<li>
<p>When you resize an instance of Nova (in the Horizon portal under <i>Project &gt; Instances</i>
            and select <i>Resize Instance</i> from the drop-down list), the system produces the
            following error: ‘‘Error: Unable to resize instance [instance name]".
            <!--(NOV-6664) (NOV-6664) --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Kernel Panic error occurs on DL 360 G7 systems when a user employs SSH to log in to a virtual machine and attempts to connect to an IP address external to HPE Helion OpenStack If this occurs, update the kernel to the latest version. <!-- (EE-21) --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a controller node crashes, it must be rebooted to return to its operational state. <!-- (CORE-1387) --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The installation process leaves behind it a running VM, and a shared internal network <codeph>default-net</codeph>.</p>

<p>This shared internal network can cause problems when running Tempest tests. If this is an issue, you can remove the <codeph>demo</codeph> VM and the <codeph>default-net</codeph> network. <!-- (CORE-586) --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Keepalived processes do not restart automatically when they are killed. Use the service <codeph>keepalived start</codeph> to restart Keepalived. <!-- (CORE-972) --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The HAProxy does not automatically restart when it is killed. Restart haproxy manually using <codeph>service haproxy restart</codeph>. <!-- (CORE-943) --></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<!--
- Heat templates and updating Helion: If you  are using a modified heat template, you should update the new templates that are provided with the installer to reflect what you had modified in your previous deployment. If you have not made any changes to the original template, then you can execute
 `./tripleo/tripleo-incubator/scripts/hp_ced_installer.sh -??-update-undercloud` 
and
 `./tripleo/tripleo-incubator/scripts/hp_ced_installer.sh -??-update-overcloud` 
to update the HEAT templates.
