<!-- modeled after HPE Cloud Networking Getting Started (network.getting.started.md) -->
<p>Based on OpenStack Keystone, the HPE Helion OpenStack Identity service provides one-stop authentication. It performs the following functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<b>User Management</b>- It tracks users and their permissions.The main components are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Users</li>
<li>Projects</li>
<li>Roles</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Service catalog</b>- It provides a catalog of available services with their API endpoints. The main components are:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Endpoints</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Identity service primarily works on the following key concepts:</p>
<section id="user"> <title>User</title>
<p>It is a digital representation of a person, system, or service who uses the cloud. The Identity authentication services validates incoming requests made by users. Users have a login and assigned tokens to access resources. Users are associated with projects based on roles assigned to them within that project.</p>
</section>
<section id="credentials"> <title>Credentials</title>
<p>Credentials are data that belongs to, is owned by and is generally only known to a user. This data is used by the user to prove his/her identity. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Username and password</li>
<li>An authentication token provided by the Identity Service</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="authentication"> <title>Authentication</title>
<p>It is the act of confirming the identity of a user. The Identity service confirms that the incoming request is being made by the user  by validating a set of claims that the user is making.</p>
</section>
<section id="token"> <title>Token</title>
<p>A random string that is used to access resources. Each token has a scope that describes which resources are accessible with it.</p>
</section>
<section id="project"> <title>Project</title>
<p>A collection of HPE service subscriptions and/or resources (Compute, Object Storage, etc).</p>
</section>
<section id="service"> <title>Service</title>
<p>An OpenStack service, such as Compute (Nova), Object Storage (Swift), or Image Service (Glance). Provides one or more endpoints through which users can access resources and perform operations.</p>
</section>
<section id="endpoint"> <title>Endpoint</title>
<p>A network-accessible address, usually described by a URL, where a service may be accessed.</p>
</section>
<section id="role"> <title>Role</title>
<p>A role defines set of rights and privileges that can be assigned to a user. A role is also called a <i>personality</i>.</p>
</section>
<section id="keystone-with-ldap"> <title>Keystone with LDAP</title>
<p>Keystone can also use Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) as source of authority authentication. <!--LDAP simplifies integration of Identity authentication into an organization's existing directory service and user account management processes.--></p>
<p>The requests to Identity service are delegated to the LDAP service which authorizes or rejects requests based on the policies that have been defined locally. A token is generated on successful authentication.</p>
<!--The Identity service enables you to create and configure users, specify user roles and credentials, and issue security tokens. The `/etc/keystone/keystone.conf` file maps LDAP attributes to Identity attributes-->

- **Token** -??- An arbitrary bit of text that is used to access resources. Each token has a scope that describes which resources are accessible with it. 

- **Project** -??- A collection of HPE service subscriptions and/or resources (Compute, Object Storage, etc). Also known as *tenant*.

- **Endpoint** -??- A network-accessible address, usually described by URL, where a service may be accessed.

- **Role** -??- A set of rights and privileges that can be assigned to a user.  A user assuming that role inherits those rights and privileges. A role is also called a *personality*.

The Identity service validates that incoming requests are being made by the user who claims to be making the call. 

The Identity service enables you to create and configure users, specify user roles and credentials, and issue security tokens. 

Users have a login and may be assigned tokens to access resources. Users can scope their authentication to a project (or, tenant) which then limits where and how their tokens can be used to interact with services. Users are assigned roles that can be used to control access to projects.

The Identity service will confirm that incoming request are being made by the user who claims to be making the call by validating a set of claims that the user is making. These claims are initially in the form of a set of credentials (username & password, or user access keys). After initial confirmation, the Identity service will issue the user a token which the user can then provide to demonstrate that their identity has been authenticated when making subsequent requests.

Users can belong to specific role(s), which is a set of rights and privileges.

## Key Terms ##

- **User** -??- A digital representation of a person, system, or service who uses the cloud. Users are associated with tenants based on roles assigned to them with that tenant.

- **Credentials** -??- Data that belongs to, is owned by, and generally only known by a user that the user can present to prove they are who they are.



- **Authentication** -??- The act of confirming the identity of a user. The Identity service confirms that incoming request are being made by the user who claims to be making the call by validating a set of claims that the user is making. 

- **Token** -??- An arbitrary bit of text that is used to access resources. Each token has a scope that describes which resources are accessible with it. 

- **Project** -??- A collection of HPE service subscriptions and/or resources (Compute, Object Storage, etc). Also known as *tenant*.

- **Endpoint** -??- A network-accessible address, usually described by URL, where a service may be accessed.

- **Role** -??- A set of rights and privileges that can be assigned to a user.  A user assuming that role inherits those rights and privileges. A role is also called a *personality*. -->
