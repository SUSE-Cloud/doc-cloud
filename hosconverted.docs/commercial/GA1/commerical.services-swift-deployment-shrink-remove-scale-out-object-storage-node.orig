## HP Helion OpenStack&#174;: Remove Scale-out Object Storage Node ##

It is recommended that you gradually reduce the weight in the ring when removing disks from the Swift cluster to avoid poor performance. 

Object nodes can only be removed once all disks have been removed from the node.

1. [Prerequisites](#prer)
2. [Removing disks from ring](#removing-disk)
3. [Removing scale-out object node](#remove-scale-out-object-node)
4. [Verify the node removal](#node-removal)

##Prerequisite {#prer}
* HP Helion OpenStack&#174; cloud is successfully deployed.<br>*(Starter Object Storage (Swift) nodes are functional by default as they are part of cloud deployment)*
* Scale-out object-ring:1 is deployed.
* All of the rings generated **must** be preserved, preferably at more than one location. Swift needs these rings to be consistent across all nodes.
* Take a backup of the rings before any operation.

##Removing disks from ring {#removing-disk}

Perform the following steps to remove the disks from ring:

1. Log in to undercloud from seed. 

		ssh heat-admin@<undercloud IP address> 
		sudo -i

2. Change the directory to ring builder.

		cd /root/ring-building

3. List the file in the directory.

		ls
	The file with the name `object-1.builder` will be listed in the list.

4. List the disks in the current `object-1.builder` file.

		ringos view-ring -f /root/ring-building/object-1.builder 

5. Identify the nodes that need to be removed from the list.

	**Recommendation**:

	Remove drives gradually using a weighted approach to avoid degraded performance of Swift cluster. The weight will gradually decrease by 25% until it becomes 0%. The initial weight is 75.

6. Set the weight of the disks on the node. 

		ringos set-weight -f object-1.builder -s d<device> -w <weight>


7. Re-balance the ring.

		ringos rebalance-ring -f /root/ring-building/object-1.builder

	**Note**: You must wait for the time specified by `min_part_hours` before another re-balance succeeds.

8. List all the Swift nodes.

		ringos list-swift-nodes -t all
		
		
9. Copy the `object-1.ring.gz` file to all nodes.

		ringos copy-ring -s /root/ring-building/object-1.ring.gz -n <Swift nodes IP address>

10. Repeat steps from **6 - 9** and decrease the weight each time until the weight becomes 0 for each disk.[Set the weight to 50, then 25, and then 0 (w= 50, 25, 0).]

11. Once weight has been set to 0, remove the disk from the ring.

    	ringos remove-disk-from-ring -f object-1.builder -s <Object Node IP address>

	Repeat this step for each disk of the specific node.

12. Re-balance the ring.

    	ringos rebalance-ring -f /root/ring-building/object-1.builder

	**Note**: You must wait for the time specified by `min_part_hours` before another re-balance succeeds.

13. List all the Swift nodes.

		# ringos list-swift-nodes -t all
		
		
14. Copy the `object-1.ring.gz` file to all nodes.

    	# ringos copy-ring -s /root/ring-building/object-1.ring.gz -n <Swift nodes IP address>

## Removing scale-out object node {#remove-scale-out-object-node}

Once the disks are removed from the ring, remove the scale-out object node by removing the corresponding stack.

To remove a node:

1. SSH to the undercloud VM:

		ssh root@<undercloud IP Address>

2. If using trickle (default):<br>
   1. Identify the MAC address of the node to be deleted.

   2. Identify the ironic **Node UUID**.

			ironic port-list --detail

	3. Identify the nova instance **Instance UUID** associated with the ironic Node UUID and, from that, identify the heat stack associated with the nova instance.

			ironic node-list

	
	The following sample displays the name of the instance.

		ov--soswiftstorage0-SwiftScaleoutObject0-2rn5k2qj3ynj
  	 
	The stack name displayed in the above sample is:

		ov--soswiftstorage0

3. Delete the stack.

		heat stack-delete <stackname>

4. Execute the following command.

		heat stack-list 

5. Execute the following command to delete a node.

		ironic node-delete <ironic_nodeid>

6. 	Mark the node as **deleted** in `baremetal.csv`. Change the **role** from `overcloudsoswiftstorage` to `overcloudsoswiftstorage:deleted`. 
	
	For example:
	
		9C:B6:54:AD:55:A8,administrator,gone2far,10.1.192.50,12,73728,70,overcloudsoswiftstorage,IPMI

    To delete the node change the role of overcloudsoswiftstorage in the `baremetal.csv` file as follows: 

		9C:B6:54:AD:55:A8,administrator,gone2far,10.1.192.50,12,73728,70,overcloudsoswiftstorage:deleted,IPMI
 
	**Note:** Do not delete the line.

7. Run the installer script.

		bash -x tripleo/tripleo-incubator/scripts/hp_ced_installer.sh --update-overcloud 2>&1 | tee update.log

When you update the cloud the node will be skipped in all the operations.



##Verify the node removal {#node-removal}

1. Use the nova list command to view a list of nodes.

		# nova list

	The removed node will not be available.

2. On seed VM, update the `kvm-custom-ips.json` file to reflect number of scale-out object nodes remaining.

		"so_swift_storage_scale": 2,
