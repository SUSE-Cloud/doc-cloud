<!-- modeled after HPE Cloud Networking Getting Started (network.getting.started.md) -->
<p>As part of that investment HPE Software has created an advanced provisioning technology, called Eve, which uses TOSCA standard semantics to express infrastructure templates that can be orchestrated against an OpenStack Nova API.  As part of the Eve advanced provisioning service, hybrid provisioning can be accomplished with common templates across public and private OpenStack API compliant clouds.</p>
<p>The Eve service is the HPE Helion OpenStack infrastructure topology provisioning service. Eve allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provision TOSCA-based infrastructure topology designs (composite, hybrid, and distributed).</li>
<li>Separate topology creation and resource pool binding, for simpler, reusable topologies.</li>
<li>Integrate via a plug-in model with Cloud API's (e.g., OpenStack Nova) for orchestrating provisioning.</li>
<li>Create and configure network services such as virtual load-balancers and configuration management services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Eve also provides a logical execution container for flexible deployment of web-scale, stateless, thread controlled, non-blocking coarse-grained services.</p>
<p>This additional functionality in Eve allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retrieve the list of provisioning jobs</li>
<li>Retrieve information about a specific provisioning job</li>
</ul>
<section id="key-terms"> <title>Key Terms</title>
<p>TOSCA: A standard means to describe the topology of applications along with dependent environments, services and artifacts inside a single service template. TOSCA standard enables each customer to deploy and manage topologies against the capabilities offered by any cloud provider, regardless of the customer's infrastructure or service model.</p>
<p>About "jobs" : A job is created when the user submits a desired topology to Eve and requests provisioning based on it. Eve creates the job and publishes status updates for it. Once the provisioning is finished, the job is marked as completed.</p>

- Terminate a running topology
- Delete a terminated topology
- Delete a running topology

### Maintain existing topologies ###

- Assign Floating IP to Server
- Unassign Floating IP from server
- Pause a Server

<p>For information on how to operate your cloud we suggest you read the <xref href="http://docs.openstack.org/ops/"   format="html" >OpenStack Operations Guide</xref> The <i>Architecture</i> section contains useful information about how an OpenStack Cloud is put together. However, the HPE Helion OpenStack edition takes care of these details for you. The <i>Operations</i> contains information on how to manage the system.</p>
