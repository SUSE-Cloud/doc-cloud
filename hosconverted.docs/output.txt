./commercial/GA1/1.0commercial.-vsa-overview.dita:<p>The following diagram displays the different development platforms supported in HPE Helion OpenStack</p>
./commercial/GA1/1.0commercial.-vsa-overview.dita:<p>There are three supported models for deploying StoreVirtual in HPE Helion OpenStack</p>
./commercial/GA1/1.0commercial.-vsa-overview.dita:<li>You can deploy and configure dedicated HPE StoreVirtual VSA Storage nodes using the HPE Helion OpenStack TripleO/Heat-based Installer. Licenses for these VSA nodes are included for use from HPE Helion OpenStack Compute Cloud Nodes only.</li>
./commercial/GA1/1.0commercial.-vsa-overview.dita:<li>User deploys and configures StoreVirtual VSA in VMware ESX platform, and maps these to Cinder backends. Licenses for these must be separately procured and are not included with HPE Helion OpenStack</li>
./commercial/GA1/1.0commercial.-vsa-overview.dita:<li>User installs StoreVirtual P4000 devices rather than using StoreVirtual VSA. These devices must be separately procured and are not included with HPE Helion OpenStack</li>
./commercial/GA1/1.0commercial.-vsa-overview.dita:<p>Cinder is the block-based storage component of the HPE  Helion OpenStack platform for cloud computing. It facilitates the provisioning of storage in the form of block devices known as Cinder volumes. In the most common scenario, the Cinder volumes provide persistent storage to guest virtual machines (known as instances) that are managed by OpenStack Compute software. Cinder is based on the distributed architecture which can scale horizontally and serve concurrent volume management requests.</p>
./commercial/GA1/1.0commercial.-vsa-overview.dita:<p>HPE Helion OpenStack uses StoreVirtual as a backend to Cinder to realize horizontally scalable block storage. StoreVirtual is unique in the sense that storage controller runs as a virtual appliance and helps realize Software Defined Block Storage.</p>
./commercial/GA1/1.0commercial.-vsa-overview.dita:<p>Differentiated storage offerings based on performance and quality can be realized in HPE Helion OpenStack by creating clusters of different capabilities, configuring clusters as backends and mapping these backends to different volume types as suggested above.</p>

./commercial/GA1/1.0commercial.install-GA-security.dita:<p>This document provides guidance on configuring your HPE Helion OpenStack network securely</p>
./commercial/GA1/1.0commercial.install-GA-security.dita:<p>HPE Helion OpenStack has many built-in security controls, but the customer must take responsibility for configuring the network devices that integrate Helion services into an existing data center environment.  This includes defining firewall rules at the edge of the HPE Helion OpenStack deployment (to protect against external abuse) as well as defining router rules within the HPE Helion OpenStack deployment (to protect against insider abuse or administrative errors).</p>
./commercial/GA1/1.0commercial.install-GA-security.dita:<p>HPE Helion OpenStack is deployed on three physical networks: IPMI, Fibre Channel, and the Cloud LAN which is subdivided into VLANs to produce the External, Management, and Service LANs as depicted in <xref type="section" href="#topic19933/fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p>
./commercial/GA1/1.0commercial.install-GA-security.dita:<section id="fig1"> <title>Figure 1: Typical HPE Helion OpenStack network topology</title>
./commercial/GA1/1.0commercial.install-GA-security.dita:<p>In <xref type="section" href="#topic19933/fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the Border Router and the Aggregation Router are customer devices that perform routing at the perimeter of the environment. The Load Balancer is a recommended customer device to provide TLS termination. The following sections provide guidance on how to configure these network devices for improved security.  Note that HPE Helion OpenStack includes IPtable rules on each node to close network ports that are not needed, but applying additional rules to your network devices (as indicated in the sections that follow) will provide increased security.</p>
./commercial/GA1/1.0commercial.install-GA-security.dita:<p>As shown in figure <xref type="section" href="#topic19933/fig1">Typical HPE Helion OpenStack network topology</xref>, all of the Cloud Controller servers are members of all three VLANs. However, these servers have IP addresses configured only for the management VLAN.</p>
./commercial/GA1/1.0commercial.install-GA-security.dita:<p>To protect against external attacks on Helion services, your firewall should be configured with a rule to block any requests originating from outside the network that attempts to reach any of the HPE Helion OpenStack nodes or any 3PAR StoreServ  or StoreVirtual VSA appliances dedicated to the HPE Helion OpenStack installation, other than those indicated this table:</p>
./commercial/GA1/1.0commercial.install-GA-security.dita:<p>The customer deploying HPE Helion OpenStack is responsible for securing the block storage networks. Network data flows for block storage should be restricted using access control lists or other mechanisms in the customer's network devices which can include routers, switches, or firewalls. Block storage data flows interacting with HPE Helion OpenStack are described here to assist with defining those controls. References are given to documentation on data flows within the storage cluster itself, but not necessarily interacting with HPE Helion OpenStack nodes.</p>
./commercial/GA1/1.0commercial.install-GA-security.dita:<p>HPE Helion OpenStack supports StoreVirtual or 3Par StoreServ storage arrays which are described separately.</p>
./commercial/GA1/1.0commercial.install-GA-security.dita:<p>HPE Helion Openstack supports iSCSI or Fibre Channel connectivity with 3PAR StoreServ. If using Fibre Channel, then the Compute nodes and the overcloud controller hosting Block Storage (Cinder) will require Fibre Channel connectivity with the 3PAR array. For iSCSI, connectivity will be through the management VLAN. The StoreServ REST API and SSH command line interfaces must be accessible from the management VLAN as well.</p>
./commercial/GA1/1.0commercial.install-GA-security.dita:<p>If your deployment includes ESX Integration, you can improve network security by configuring access control lists for the ESX network.  The ESX Tenant network (also shown below) is managed by the Networking Operations service (Neutron).  The ESX network is not installed or managed by HPE Helion OpenStack You must install and manage this network and makes sure there is a route to the Management network.</p>

./commercial/GA1/1.1.1commercial.helion-update.dita:<p>Welcome to the HPE Helion OpenStack v1.1.1 update instructions. These instructions apply to existing HPE Helion OpenStack v1.1 installations and describe how you can update your HPE Helion OpenStack cloud environment from v1.1 to v1.1.1. (The process of updating a HPE Helion OpenStack v1.0 or v1.01 release to HPE Helion OpenStack v1.1.1 is not supported.)</p>

./commercial/GA1/1.1.1commercial.helion-update.dita:**Note for Helion Development Platform version v1.1 users**: This Helion OpenStack version v1.1.1 update procedure supports Helion Development Platform version v1.2, (and only Helion Development Platform version v1.2). For users who have installed Helion OpenStack v1.1 and Helion Development Platform v1.1, when you update to HPE Helion OpenStack v1.1.1, you also need to update to Helion Development Platform v1.2.  
./commercial/GA1/1.1.1commercial.helion-update.dita:**Important for HPE Helion Development Platform users**: During the HPE Helion OpenStack v1.1.1 update, you will need to stop your Helion Development Platform services. Failure to do so will likely damage your existing Helion Development Platform v1.1 installation.

./commercial/GA1/1.1commcerical.install-TLS.dita:<p>The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, successor of SSL, provides the mechanisms to ensure authentication, non-repudiation, confidentiality, and integrity of user communications to the HPE Helion OpenStack services and between the HPE Helion OpenStack services themselves.</p>
./commercial/GA1/1.1commcerical.install-TLS.dita:<p>The TLS connections are facilitated by providing each node with a signed certificate from an internal certificate authority server (Ephemeral CA server) that is built into HPE Helion OpenStack and installed on the Overcloud Controller nodes. These certificates are regenerated frequently - typically at least every 12 hours. The Helion Ephemeral certificate authority (CA) server uses a private key to sign these certificates provided to the OpenStack services, and an associated public certificate can be used to validate these newly signed certs. This key/cert pair can either be generated at installation time or be provided by the installer as an input to the installation process.  If you would like to use certificates from your own CA, please see <xref href="../../commercial/GA1/1.1.1commerical.services-customer-provided-certificates.dita">Configuring support for customer-provided certificates</xref>.</p>
./commercial/GA1/1.1commcerical.install-TLS.dita:<p>If the deployer has not provided a key/cert pair, the self-signed certificate created during the installation process must be retrieved from the seed at /root/eca.crt after deployment. This certificate can then be used to authenticate the TLS connection when connecting to any of the overcloud OpenStack services in the HPE Helion OpenStack cloud. This can be retrieved using the following command:</p>
./commercial/GA1/1.1commcerical.install-TLS.dita:<p>If a self-signed certificate was created during the HPE Helion OpenStack installation, you must install the generated certificate in your browser as a trusted CA to prevent messages about insecure connections when connecting to the Horizon IP address. This can be done by importing the eca.crt file from the seed VM as a trusted CA into your browser software.</p>

./commercial/GA1/1.1commercial.-vsa-overview.dita:<li>You can deploy and configure dedicated HPE StoreVirtual VSA Storage nodes using the HPE Helion OpenStack TripleO/Heat-based Installer. Licenses for these VSA nodes are included for use from HPE Helion OpenStack Compute Cloud Nodes only.</li>

./commercial/GA1/1.1commercial.-vsa-overview.dita:<p>Cinder is the block-based storage component of the HPE  Helion OpenStack platform for cloud computing. It facilitates the provisioning of storage in the form of block devices known as Cinder volumes. In the most common scenario, the Cinder volumes provide persistent storage to guest virtual machines (known as instances) that are managed by OpenStack Compute software. Cinder is based on the distributed architecture which can scale horizontally and serve concurrent volume management requests.</p>
./commercial/GA1/1.1commercial.-vsa-overview.dita:<p>HPE Helion OpenStack uses StoreVirtual as a backend to Cinder to realize horizontally scalable block storage. StoreVirtual is unique in the sense that storage controller runs as a virtual appliance and helps realize Software Defined Block Storage.</p>
./commercial/GA1/1.1commercial.-vsa-overview.dita:<p>Differentiated storage offerings based on performance and quality can be realized in HPE Helion OpenStack by creating clusters of different capabilities, configuring clusters as backends and mapping these backends to different volume types as suggested above.</p>

./commercial/GA1/1.1commercial.install-GA-security.dita:<p>HPE Helion OpenStack has many built-in security controls, but the customer must take responsibility for configuring the network devices that integrate Helion services into an existing data center environment.  This includes defining firewall rules at the edge of the HPE Helion OpenStack deployment (to protect against external abuse) as well as defining router rules within the HPE Helion OpenStack deployment (to protect against insider abuse or administrative errors).</p>
./commercial/GA1/1.1commercial.install-GA-security.dita:<p>HPE Helion OpenStack is deployed on three physical networks: IPMI, Fibre Channel, and the Cloud LAN which is subdivided into VLANs to produce the External, Management, and Service LANs as depicted in <xref type="section" href="#topic20483/fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

./commercial/GA1/1.1commerical.services-reporting-overview.dita:<p>The HPE Helion OpenStack Metering service leverages the OpenStack Ceilometer service. A metering service takes specified measurements of both physical and virtual resources, including physical servers and network devices such as switches and firewalls. No matter what purpose the data is used for, this service provides a reliable, consistent method for data collection.</p>
./commercial/GA1/1.1commerical.services-reporting-overview.dita:<p>The metering service is automatically installed as part of the HPE Helion OpenStack installation process. It may be necessary to install the command-line interface (<xref href="http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/content/install_clients.html" scope="external" format="html" >CLI</xref>) separately to perform various administrative tasks.</p>
./commercial/GA1/1.1commerical.services-reporting-overview.dita:<p>The initial default configuration enables a limited subset of all potential meters, collecting a few essential measurements from the Nova, Cinder, Glance, and Neutron services only. With these measurements, the Ceilometer API can begin collecting basic Helion OpenStack usage and status information.</p>
./commercial/GA1/1.1commerical.services-reporting-overview.dita:<p>Additional metrics collection for all of the HPE Helion OpenStack infrastructure services, as well as other application and platform services, are targeted for future Helion OpenStack releases.</p>

Hence, any end user can gain access into a Helion system with this integration. To minimize risks, an external HAProxy is built in a DMZ environment behind a firewall. HAProxy is commonly used as a load balancer for TCP- and HTTP-based applications. It works as a reverse-proxy, which means it maintains two connections when allowing a client to cross it: a connection between HAProxy and the client, and  another between HAProxy and the server.</p>

./commercial/GA1/neutron/1.1commercial_neutron-post-installation-configure-network.dita:<p>HPE Helion OpenStack has many built-in security controls, but the customer must take responsibility for configuring the network devices that integrate Helion services into an existing data center environment. This includes defining firewall rules at the edge of the HPE Helion OpenStack deployment (to protect against external abuse) as well as defining router rules within the HPE Helion OpenStack deployment (to protect against insider abuse or administrative errors).</p>
./commercial/GA1/neutron/1.1commercial_neutron-post-installation-configure-network.dita:<p>HPE Helion OpenStack is deployed on three physical networks: IPMI, Fibre Channel, and the Cloud LAN which is subdivided into VLANs to produce the External, Management, and Service LANs as depicted in the following figure.</p>

./commercial/GA1/neutron/1.1commercial_neutron-post-installation-configure-network.dita:<p>In the above figure, the Border Router and the Aggregation Router are customer devices that perform routing at the perimeter of the environment. The Load Balancer is a recommended customer device to provide TLS termination. The following sections provide guidance on how to configure these network devices for improved security. Note that HPE Helion OpenStack includes IPtable rules on each node to close network ports that are not needed, but applying additional rules to your network devices (as indicated in the sections that follow) will provide increased security.</p>
./commercial/GA1/neutron/1.1commercial_neutron-post-installation-configure-network.dita:<p>The perimeter is indicated by the Border Router icon in <xref type="section" href="#topic19956/fig1">Typical HPE Helion OpenStack network topology</xref>

However, these servers have IP addresses configured only for the management VLAN.</p>
./commercial/GA1/neutron/1.1commercial_neutron-post-installation-configure-network.dita:<p>To protect against external attacks on Helion services, your firewall should be configured with a rule to block any requests originating from outside the network that attempts to reach any of the HPE Helion OpenStack nodes or any 3PAR StoreServ  or StoreVirtual VSA appliances dedicated to the HPE Helion OpenStack installation, other than those indicated this table:</p>

Block storage data flows interacting with HPE Helion OpenStack are described here to assist with defining those controls. References are given to documentation on data flows within the storage cluster itself, but not necessarily interacting with HPE Helion OpenStack nodes.</p>

Note that 2.1 (not 2.0) as well supports multiple network model for Ceph, although it is not captured as default model.
