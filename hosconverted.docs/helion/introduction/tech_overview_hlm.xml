      <title>Lifecycle management</title>
      

      <p>
        
        Performing software installation and configuration activity can be time consuming, complex 
        and often error prone. To help with this process, <keyword keyref="kw-hos-phrase"/> provides lifecycle 
        management tools as a way to simplify and accelerate the process of installing and performing 
        on-going lifecycle operations for OpenStack clouds.
        The goal is to provide flexible, yet easy-to-use tools that will reduce the time taken to deploy a cloud
        while minimizing the errors that can occur in a manual process. 
        The lifecycle management tools use the Ansible open source automation engine for deploying 
        and configuring the OpenStack Software.

      <title>Ansible</title>
      <p>Ansible is an IT automation engine that can be used for automating cloud provisioning, 
        configuration management, application deployment, intraservice orchestration, 
        and many other IT needs. Being designed for multi-tier deployments, Ansible models 
        IT infrastructure by describing how systems inter-relate, rather than just managing one 
        system at a time. Ansible uses no agents and no additional custom security infrastructure, 
        so it is easy to deploy. HPE created a set of Ansible scripts known as <codeph>Playbooks</codeph>  to install, 
        configure, maintain and update <keyword keyref="kw-hos-phrase"/>. These playbooks are collectively 
        known as the <b>Helion Lifecycle Manager</b>.</p>
      
      <p>During installation of <keyword keyref="kw-hos-phrase"/>, the core OpenStack services, 
        such as compute, networking, orchestration, storage, identity, etc. are installed automatically, 
        and by default. These services are integrated and work together out of the box. Rather than 
        configuring each service individually and configuring their interaction, 
        the <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> lifecycle manager provides scripts that perform the integrations for you.</p>

    <section>
      <title>Example Configurations</title>
      <p><keyword keyref="kw-hos-phrase"/> clouds are defined through a set of configuration files 
        in a simple text-based format called YAML. These files are collectively referred to as the 
        <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> input model. Rather than needing to define a cloud from scratch every time,
        <keyword keyref="kw-hos-phrase"/> includes a series of starting point examples that reflect 
        some of the more common cloud configurations in use today. When deploying an initial 
        <keyword keyref="kw-hos-phrase"/> cloud, you can choose to start with one of the supplied examples 
        that is closest to your desired configuration and modify it with the specific 
        configuration data for your environment.

      <title>Cobbler</title>
      
      <p>Cobbler is a Linux installation server that allows for rapid setup of network installation 
        environments. It glues together and automates many associated Linux tasks so you do not have 
        to hop between many various commands and applications when deploying new systems, and, 
        in some cases, changing existing ones. Cobbler can help with provisioning, managing DNS and DHCP, 
        package updates, power management, configuration management orchestration, and much more. 
        <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> lifecycle manager utilizes Cobbler as an included and optional baremetal deployer.</p>
      
      
      <p>
        Before the installation of OpenStack, each server needs to have the basic Linux for HPE Helion OS 
        installed along with SSH and security certificates.
        Helion OpenStack uses Cobbler, IPMI and baremetal Ansible playbooks to accomplish this.
        When Cobbler is deployed, it utilizes the baremetal information specified in the servers model. 
        The MAC and IP address specified for each node
        on the baremetal/PXE installation network is loaded into Cobbler.
        Once Cobbler has been configured, the baremetal playbooks are used to re-image each of the 
        servers that are being provisioned. Each server
        uses PXE to boot into the Cobbler installer, which lays down the OS and security certificates. 
        The servers are then rebooted to the new OS image
        on the internal hard disks and are ready for the final installation phase.

    <section>
      <title>Configuration Processor</title>
      
      <p>The configuration processor reads and validates the input model described in the YAML files. It 
        combines this information with the service definitions provided by <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> and any 
        persisted state information about the current deployment and then generates the data 
        that is used by the Asible Playbooks to deploy the cloud. It also produces a set of 
        information files that provide details about the configuration. </p>
      
      <p>Once the configuration processor has been run successfully, 
        a staging area is created and populated with the playbooks and configuration 
        files required for the final deployment. </p>

    <section>
      <title>Installing and Configuring OpenStack Services</title>
      <p>
        There are two major phases to the final deployment:
        <ul>
          <li>Configuring the OS</li>
          <li>Installing OpenStack services</li>
          
        </ul>

        The OS Configuration phase installs and configures services such as networking, 
        iptables, NTP and root disk layouts. This phase also transitions
        hostnames and implements a common <codeph>/etc/hosts</codeph> file.
        The OpenStack install phase runs a deploy playbook for each service. Based on the server role, 
        these playbooks would also configure additional
        disks for services like nova, cinder, swift and ceph. As each service is installed, 
        the appropriate Monasca alarm definitions are also created. The
        Monasca alarm definitions can be modified and added to. </p>

    <section>
      <title>Upgrade</title>
      
      <p><keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> uses Helion Lifecycle Manager for hotfixes, patches, updates and upgrades.
        The lifecycle manager ensures that intermediate upgrade states are persisted, even if upgrade is aborted
        and that persisted states are reused when upgrade is retried
