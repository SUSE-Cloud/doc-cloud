              example, higher performance for block and lower for Object?</entry>
            <entry>Yes, but <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> default CRUSH map does not do this. You need
              to manually edit the CRUSH map and define the buckets and create rules to choose high
              performance disks to block storage and slower performance disks to object storage.

            <entry>Yes, you can change the nova scheduler to other available schedulers by making

              ~/helion/my_cloud/config/nova/nova.conf.j2 and run the nova-reconfigure playbook to

            <entry>You can't enable the Jumbo frames or MTU increase for a single neutron network.
              It needs to be enabled at the Entire L2 broadcast domain level. I.e From physical to
