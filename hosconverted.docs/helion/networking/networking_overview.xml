    <p><keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> Networking is a virtual networking service that leverages the OpenStack
      Neutron service to provide network connectivity and addressing to <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> Compute
      service devices.</p>
    <p>The Networking service also provides an API to configure and manage a variety of network
      services.</p>
    <p>You can use the Networking service to connect guest servers or you can define and configure
      your own virtual network topology.</p>
    <!--
    <p>You can also use the Networking service to identify the actual IP address of a malicious
      user, if you know the user's NAT address. For more information, see <xref
        href="../../commercial/GA1/1.1commercial.networking-maskedIP.dita">Tracking masked IP
        addresses when using network address translation (NAT)</xref>.</p>

      <title>Reconfiguring the Networking service</title>
      <p>If you change any of the network configuration after installation, it is recommended that
        you reconfigure the Networking service by running the neutron-reconfigure playbook.</p>
      <p>On the lifecycle manager:</p>
      <codeblock>cd ~/helion/hlm/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts neutron-reconfigure.yml</codeblock>

      <title>Using the API</title>
      <p>You can use a low-level, raw REST API to access the Networking service. See the <xref

      <title>Using the CLI</title>
      <p>You can use any of several command-line interface software to access Networking. See the
