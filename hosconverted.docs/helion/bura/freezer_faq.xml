    <section>I did not set up SSH backups before installing <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/>. How can I set it
      up now?</section>
    <section>I have backed up my data outside the cluster to plan for complete disaster recovery.
      How can I recover that data?  using the SSH recovery procedure.</section>

<section>How do I restore from an older backup? I only see the most recent backups listed.</section>
    <section>Where are Freezer scheduler and Freezer agent  installed in 20 21? on controller nodes
      and lifecycle manager nodes. They are also installed on compute and VSA nodes but nothing is
      being backed up there.<p/></section>
    <section>If  I lose a controller node completely, i.e. the hardware is unusable, how can I
      restore the data I need? the necessary data for the lost controller can be recovered from
      MySQL.</section>
    <section>Freezer is installed on VSA and compute nodes but no automatic backups happen on the nodes. However, you can create jobs to backup
    data on those nodes by manually creating backup jobs. Because the Freezer agen and scheduler are installed, you do not have to install them 
    on these nodes, just create the jobs.</section>
