    <section><b>Set up the lifecycle manager</b>
      <ol id="ol_e4s_nfz_bv">
        <li>Ensuring that you use the same version of <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> that you previously
          had loaded on your lifecycle manager, you will need to download and install the lifecycle
          management software using the instructions from the installation guide: </li>
        <li> Then you will want to restore your data using the Deployer Disaster Recovery
          instructions. These details are included at the end of the document </li>
        <li> Update your cloud model (servers.yml) with the new mac-addr, ilo-ip, ilo-password, or
          ilo-user fields where these have changed. Do not change the id, ip-addr, role, or
          server-group settings. (Please follow the procedure for updating your cloud model in the
          git repo) </li>
        <li> Get the servers.yml file, which is stored in git:
          <codeblock>cd ~/helion/my_cloud/definition/data
git checkout site</codeblock>
        </li>
        <li> then change, as necessary, the mac-addr, ilo-ip, ilo-password, and ilo-user fields of
          this existing controller node. Save and commit the change
          <codeblock>git commit -a -m "repaired node X"</codeblock>
        </li>
        <li> Run the configuration processor as follows:
          <codeblock>cd ~/helion/hos/ansible 
ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost config-processor-run.yml</codeblock>
        </li>
        <li> Then run ready-deployment:
          <codeblock>cd ~/helion/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost ready-deployment.yml</codeblock>
        </li>
        <li> Once that is complete, copy the Cobbler images to the correct location:
          <codeblock>sudo mkdir -p /srv/www/cobbler/ks_mirror/hlinux-cattleprod 
sudo cp /opt/hlm_packager/hlm/hlinux/dists/cattleprod/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/debian-installer/amd64/linux /srv/www/cobbler/ks_mirror/hlinux-cattleprod
sudo cp /opt/hlm_packager/hlm/hlinux/dists/cattleprod/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/debian-installer/amd64/initrd.gz /srv/www/cobbler/ks_mirror/hlinux-cattleprod</codeblock>
        </li>
        <li> Deploy Cobbler:
          <codeblock>cd ~/helion/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost cobbler-deploy.yml</codeblock>
          Note: After this step you may see failures because MySQL has not finished syncing. If so,
          please rerun this step (7). </li>
        <li> Delete the haproxy user: <codeblock>sudo deluser haproxy</codeblock>
        </li>
        <li> Manually copy the /etc/group file from a backup of the old deployer. Note, currently
          Freezer does not back up /etc/group file, so it won't get restored when freezer deployer
          backup is restored. Until that is fixed, we need to follow this workaround <p/>Remove the
          /home/dbadmin/.ssh/id_rsa file to rebuild the SSH keys required to install vertica
          <codeblock>sudo rm /home/dbadmin/.ssh/id_rsa</codeblock>
        </li>
        <li> Configure the necessary keys used for the database etc: <codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts monasca-rebuild-pretasks.yml</codeblock>
          <p>Log into the surviving controller nodes and run the following command:</p><p>
            <codeblock>sudo ssh-keygen -f "/home/dbadmin/.ssh/known_hosts" -R {{ip_of_node_to_replace}}</codeblock>
          </p></li>
        <li> Run osconfig on the replacement controller node. For example:
          <codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts osconfig-run.yml -e rebuild=True --limit=&lt;controller-hostname></codeblock>
          If the controller being replaced is the first server running the swift-proxy service (see
          Identifying the First Proxy Server) you need to restore the Swift Ring Builder files to
          the /etc/swiftlm/builder_dir directory. See Recovering Builder Files for details. </li>
        <li> Run the hlm-deploy playbook on the replacement controller. If the node being replaced
          is the first proxy node then you only need to use the --limit switch for that node,
          otherwise you need to specify the hostname of your first proxy and the hostname of the
          node being
          replaced.<codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts hlm-deploy.yml -e rebuild=True --limit=&lt;controller-hostname>,&lt;first-proxy-hostname></codeblock>
        </li>
        <li> If the node being replaced does not host any swift services then you only need to use
          the --limit switch for that node
          <codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts hlm-deploy.yml -e rebuild=True --limit=&lt;controller-hostname></codeblock>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p><b>Deployer Disaster Recovery Options</b></p>
      <ol id="ol_mts_nfz_bv">
        <li>On the lifecycle manager, install the freezer-agent, as follows:
          <codeblock>cd ~/helion/hos/ansible/ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost _deployer_restore_helper.yml -e '{ "old_deployer_hostname": "&lt;here put the hostname of the server that was your deployer>" }'</codeblock>
        </li>
        <li> You must retrieve a few files from any compute or controller node and put them in the
          directory /opt/stack/service/freezer-agent/etc/ of the lifecycle manager:
          /home/stack/backup.osrc and/opt/stack/service/freezer-agent/etc/systemd_env_vars.cfg </li>
      </ol>

    <section>Everything is still running (control plane nodes and compute nodes) but you lost the
      lifecycle manager. <p/>

        Procedure</b><p/><!-- Thursday, February 04, 2016 10:32
      PM HOS 3.0 Page 1 Question: When deployer is down, we can't access either compute or
      controller nodes unless the public keys are stored somewhere But this is not documented. --><ol
        id="ol_rws_nfz_bv">
        <li>Become root <codeblock>sudo su</codeblock>

        <li>Run the following command to change the host name
          <codeblock>hostname &lt;here put the hostname of the server that was your deployer></codeblock>
          Edit the /etc/hosts and replace the default hLinux install name (hlm) with the old
          deployer name which modified in above step iii. </li>
        <li> Change the hostname of the server so it points to the hostname of the server that was
          your deployer and update /etc/hosts file according On the lifecycle manager: Become root

        <li> Question>> backup.osrc file points to HOSTNAME of the VIP address. <p/>
        </li>
        <li>When deployer is reinstalled it won't have details of the HOSTNAME of the VIP in the
          /etc/hosts file. This command would fail, example <p/>
          <codeblock>curl http://companyHOS20HDP-ccp1-vip-KEY-API-mgmt:5000 curl
Could not resolve host: companyHOS20HDP-ccp1-vip-KEY-API-mgmt </codeblock>
        </li>
        <li>We need to add to the document to edit the /etc/hosts file of the deployer and add the
          VIP hostname/IP address details. </li>
        <li>Get the id of the job corresponding to "HLM Default: Deployer restore from Swift </li>
        <li> Stop that job so the freezer-scheduler doesn't begin to backup when started
