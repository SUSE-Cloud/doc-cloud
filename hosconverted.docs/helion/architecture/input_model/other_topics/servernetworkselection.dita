    <p>Once the configuration processor has allocated a <uicontrol>server</uicontrol> to a
        <uicontrol>cluster</uicontrol> or <uicontrol>resource group</uicontrol> it uses the
        information in the associated <uicontrol>interface-model</uicontrol> to determine which
        <uicontrol>networks</uicontrol> need to be configured. It does this by:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Looking at the <uicontrol>service-components</uicontrol> that are to run on the server
            (from the <uicontrol>control-plane</uicontrol> definition)</li>
        <li>Looking to see which <uicontrol>network-group</uicontrol> each of those components is
            attached to (from the <uicontrol>network-groups</uicontrol> definition)</li>
        <li>Looking to see if there are any <uicontrol>network-tags</uicontrol> related to a
            <uicontrol>service-component</uicontrol> running on this server, and if so, adding those
            <uicontrol>network-groups</uicontrol> to the list (also from the
            <uicontrol>network-groups</uicontrol> definition)</li>
        <li>Looking to see if there are any <uicontrol>network-groups</uicontrol> that the
            <uicontrol>interface-model</uicontrol> says should be forced onto the server</li>
        <li>It then searches the <uicontrol>server-group</uicontrol> hierarchy (as described in
            <xref keyref="concept_servergroups_networks">Server Groups and Networks</xref>) to
            find a <uicontrol>network</uicontrol> in each of the <uicontrol>network-groups</uicontrol>
            it needs to attach to</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If there is no <uicontrol>network</uicontrol> available to a server, either because the
        <uicontrol>interface-model</uicontrol> doesn't include the required
        <uicontrol>network-group</uicontrol>, or there is no <uicontrol>network</uicontrol> from
        that group in the appropriate part of the <uicontrol>server-groups</uicontrol> hierarchy,
        then the configuration processor will generate an error.</p>
    <p>The configuration processor will also generate an error if the
        <uicontrol>server</uicontrol> address does not match any of the networks it will be
        connected to.</p>
