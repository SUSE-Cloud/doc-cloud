        <p>Configuration Data is used to provide settings which have to be applied in a specific context, 
            or where the data needs to be verified against or merged with other values in the input model.   
            
            </p>
        <p>
                
        For example, when defining a Neutron provider network to be used by Octavia, the network 
        needs to be included in the routing configuration generated by the Configuration Processor.
