    <p><i>A <uicontrol>control-plane</uicontrol> runs one or more
        <uicontrol>services</uicontrol>.</i></p>
    <p>A service is the collection of <uicontrol>service-components</uicontrol> that provide a
        particular feature; for example, Nova provides the compute service and consists of the
        following service-components: nova-api, nova-scheduler, nova-conductor, nova-novncproxy, and
        nova-compute. Some services, like the authentication/identity service Keystone, only consist
        of a single service-component.</p>
    <p>To define your cloud, all you need to know about a service are the names of the
        <uicontrol>service-components</uicontrol>. The details of the services themselves and how
        they interact with each other is captured in service definition files provided by 
        <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/>.</p>
    <p>When specifying your <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> cloud you have to decide where components will
        run and how they connect to the networks. For example, should they all run in one
        <uicontrol>control-plane</uicontrol> sharing common services or be distributed across
        multiple <uicontrol>control-planes</uicontrol> to provide separate instances of some
        services? The <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> supplied examples provide solutions for some typical
        configurations.</p>
    <p>Where services run is defined in the <uicontrol>control-plane</uicontrol>. How they connect
        to networks is defined in the <uicontrol>network-groups</uicontrol>.</p>
