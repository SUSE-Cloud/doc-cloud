    <p>Each L3 <uicontrol>network</uicontrol> in a cloud must be associated with all or some of
        the <uicontrol>servers</uicontrol>, typically following a physical pattern (such as having
        separate networks for each rack or set of racks). This is also represented in the
        <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> model via <uicontrol>server-groups</uicontrol>, each group lists zero or more
        networks to which <uicontrol>servers</uicontrol> associated with
        <uicontrol>server-groups</uicontrol> at or below this point in the hierarchy are
        connected.</p>
    <p>When the configuration processor needs to resolve the specific
        <uicontrol>network</uicontrol> a <uicontrol>server</uicontrol> should be configured to
        use, it traverses up the hierarchy of <uicontrol>server-groups</uicontrol>, starting with
        the group the server is directly associated with, until it finds a server-group that lists a
        network in the required network group.</p>
    <p>The level in the <uicontrol>server-group</uicontrol> hierarchy at which a
        <uicontrol>network</uicontrol> is associated will depend on the span of connectivity it
        must provide. In the above example there might be networks in some
        <uicontrol>network-groups</uicontrol> which are per rack (i.e. Rack 1 and Rack 2 list
        different networks from the same <uicontrol>network-group</uicontrol>) and
        <uicontrol>networks</uicontrol> in a different <uicontrol>network-group</uicontrol> that
        span failure zones (the network used to provide floating IP addresses to virtual machines
        for example).</p>
