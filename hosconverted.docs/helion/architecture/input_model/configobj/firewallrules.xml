    <p>The configuration processor will automatically generate "allow" firewall rules for each
        server based on the services deployed and block all other ports. The firewall rules in the
        input model allow the customer to define additional rules for each network group.</p>
    <p>Administrator-defined rules are applied after all rules generated by the Configuration
        Processor.</p>
