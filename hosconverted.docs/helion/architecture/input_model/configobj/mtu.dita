            A network group may optionally specify an MTU for its networks to use. Because a 
            network-interface in the interface-model may have a mix of one untagged-vlan network 
            group and one or more tagged-vlan network groups, there are some special requirements 
            when specifying an MTU on a network group.
        </p>
        
        <p>If the network group consists of untagged-vlan network(s) then its specified MTU 
            must be greater than or equal to the MTU of any tagged-vlan network groups which are 
            co-located on the same network-interface.
        </p>
        
        <p>For example consider a network group with untagged VLANs, NET-GROUP-1, which 
            is going to share (via a Network Interface definition) a device (eth0) with two 
            network groups with tagged VLANs: NET-GROUP-2 (ID=201, MTU=1550) and  NET-GROUP-3 
            (ID=301, MTU=9000). </p>
        
        <p>The device (eth0) must have an MTU which is large enough to accommodate the VLAN in 
            NET-GROUP-3. Since NET-GROUP-1 has untagged VLANS it will also be using this device 
            and so it must also have an MTU of 9000, which results in the following configuration. </p>
        
<codeblock>
    +eth0 (9000)   &lt;------ this MTU comes from NET-GROUP-1
    | |
    | |----+ vlan201@eth0 (1550)
    \------+ vlan301@eth0 (9000)

</codeblock>        
        
        <p>Where an interface is used only by network groups with tagged VLANs the MTU of the 
            device or bond will be set to the highest MTU value in those groups.  </p>
        
        <p>For example if bond0 is configured to be used by three network groups: NET-GROUP-1 
            (ID=101, MTU=3000) , NET-GROUP-2 (ID=201, MTU=1550) and  NET-GROUP-3 (ID=301, MTU=9000).</p>
        
        <p>Then the resulting configuration would be:</p>
        
<codeblock>
    +bond0 (9000)   &lt;------ because of NET-GROUP-3
    | | |
    | | |--+vlan101@bond0 (3000)
    | |----+vlan201@bond0 (1550)
    |------+vlan301@bond0 (9000)
</codeblock>
