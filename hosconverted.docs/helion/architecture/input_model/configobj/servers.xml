    <p>The <uicontrol>servers</uicontrol> configuration object is used to list the available
        servers for deploying the cloud.</p>
    <p>Optionally, it can be used as an input file to the operating system installation process,
        in which case some additional fields (identified below) will be necessary.</p>
