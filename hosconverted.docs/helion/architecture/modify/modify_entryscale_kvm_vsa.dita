    <p>This section covers the changes that need to be made to the input model to deploy and run
        this cloud model in your environment.</p>
    <p>This section is written from the perspective of the <codeph>entry-scale-kvm-vsa</codeph>
        example, although the same principles apply to all of the examples.</p>
    <p>There are two categories of modifications that we will look at:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b><xref keyref="localizing_inputmodel">Localizations</xref></b> - These are the minimum set of changes that you need to make to
            adapt the examples to run in your environment. These are mostly concerned with
            networking.</li>
        <li><b><xref keyref="customizing_inputmodel">Customizations</xref></b> - These describe more general changes that you can make to your
            model, e.g. changing disk storage layouts.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Note that, as a convention, the examples use upper case for the object names, but these
        strings are only used to define the relationships between objects and have no specific
        significance to the configuration processor. You can change the names to values that are
        relevant to your context providing you do so consistently across the input model.</p>
