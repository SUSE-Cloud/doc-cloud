    <p>Existing OpenStack service logging varies widely across services. Generally, log messages do
      not have enough detail about who is requesting the application program interface (API), or
      enough context-specific details about an action performed. Often details are not even
      consistently logged across various services, leading to inconsistent data formats being used
      across services. These issues make it difficult to integrate logging with existing audit tools
      and processes.</p>
    <p>To help you monitor your workload and data in compliance with your corporate, industry or
      regional policies, <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> provides auditing support as a basic security
      feature. The audit logging can be integrated with customer Security Information and Event
      Management (SIEM) tools and support your efforts to correlate threat forensics. </p>
    <p>The <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> audit logging feature uses Audit Middleware for Python
      services. This middleware service is based on OpenStack services which use the Paste Deploy
      system. Most OpenStack services use the paste deploy mechanism to find and configure WSGI
      servers and applications. Utilizing the paste deploy system provides auditing support in
      services with minimal changes.</p>
    <p>By default, audit logging as a post-installation feature is disabled in the cloudConfig file
      on the lifecycle manager and it can only be enabled after <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/>
      installation or upgrade.</p>
    <p>The tasks in this section explain how to enable services for audit logging in your
      environment. <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> provides audit logging for the following services:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Nova</li>
      <li>Barbican</li>
      <li>Keystone</li>
      <li>Cinder</li>
      <li>Ceilometer</li>
      <li>Neutron</li>
      <li>Glance</li>
      <li>Heat</li>
    </ul>
