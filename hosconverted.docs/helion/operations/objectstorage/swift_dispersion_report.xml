    <section id="about">
      <p>Swift contains a tool called <codeph>swift-dispersion-report</codeph> that can be used to
        determine whether your containers and objects have three replicas like they are supposed to.
        This tool works by populating a percentage of partitions in the system with containers and
        objects (using <codeph>swift-dispersion-populate</codeph>) and then running the report to
        see if all the replicas of these containers and objects are in the correct place. For a more
        detailed explanation of this tool in Openstack Swift, please see <xref
          href="http://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/admin_guide.html#cluster-health"

    <section><title>Configuring the Swift dispersion populate</title>
      <p>Once a Swift system has been fully deployed in <keyword keyref="kw-hos-phrase"/>, you can
        setup the swift-dispersion-report using the default parameters found in
          <codeph>~/helion/hos/ansible/roles/swift-dispersion/templates/dispersion.conf.j2</codeph>.
        This populates 1% of the partitions on the system and if you are happy with this figure,
        please proceed to step 2 below. Otherwise, follow step 1 to edit the configuration file.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>If you wish to change the dispersion coverage percentage then edit the value of
            <codeph>dispersion_coverage</codeph> in the
            <codeph>~/helion/hos/ansible/roles/swift-dispersion/templates/dispersion.conf.j2</codeph>
          file to the value you wish to use. In the example below we have altered the file to create
          5% dispersion:
          <codeblock>...
[dispersion]
auth_url = {{ keystone_identity_uri }}/v3
auth_user = {{ swift_dispersion_tenant }}:{{ swift_dispersion_user }}
auth_key = {{ swift_dispersion_password  }}
endpoint_type = {{ endpoint_type }}
auth_version = {{ disp_auth_version }}
# Set this to the percentage coverage. We recommend a value
# of 1%. You can increase this to get more coverage. However, if you
# decrease the value, the dispersion containers and objects are
# not deleted.
<b>dispersion_coverage = 5.0</b></codeblock></li>
        <li>Commit your configuration to the <xref href="../../installation/using_git.xml">local
            git repo</xref>, as follows:
          <codeblock>git add -A
git commit -m "My config or other commit message"</codeblock></li>
        <li>Run the configuration processor:
          <codeblock>cd ~/helion/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost config-processor-run.yml</codeblock></li>
        <li>Update your deployment directory:
          <codeblock>cd ~/helion/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost ready-deployment.yml</codeblock></li>
        <li>Reconfigure the Swift servers:
          <codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible 
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts swift-reconfigure.yml</codeblock></li>
        <li>Run this playbook to populate your Swift system for the health check:
          <codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts swift-dispersion-populate.yml</codeblock></li>
      </ol>

    <section><title>Running the Swift dispersion report</title>
      <p>Check the status of the Swift system by running the Swift dispersion report with this
        playbook:</p>
      <codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts swift-dispersion-report.yml</codeblock>
      <p>The output of the report will look similar to this:</p>
      <codeblock>TASK: [swift-dispersion | report | Display dispersion report results] *********
ok: [padawan-ccp-c1-m1-mgmt] => {
    "var": {
        "dispersion_report_result.stdout_lines": [
            "Using storage policy: General ",
            "",
            "\u001b[KQueried 40 containers for dispersion reporting, 0s, 0 retries",
            "100.00% of container copies found (120 of 120)",
            "Sample represents 0.98% of the container partition space",
            "",
            "\u001b[KQueried 40 objects for dispersion reporting, 0s, 0 retries",
            "There were 40 partitions missing 0 copies.",
            "100.00% of object copies found (120 of 120)",
            "Sample represents 0.98% of the object partition space"
        ]
    }
}
...</codeblock>
      <p>In addition to being able to run the report above, there will be a cron-job running every 2
        hours on the first proxy node of your system that will run
          <codeph>dispersion-report</codeph> and save the results to the following file:</p>
      <codeblock>/var/cache/swift/dispersion-report</codeblock>
      <p>When interpreting the results you get from this report, we recommend using <xref
          href="http://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/admin_guide.html#cluster-health"
