    <section id="about">
      <p>This page describes a general approach for making changes to your existing Swift rings.
        This approach applies to actions such as adding and removing a server and replacing and
        upgrading disk drives, and must be performed as a series of phases, as shown below:</p>
    </section>
    <section id="change_inputmodel"><title>Changing the Input Model Configuration Files</title>
      <p>The first step to apply new changes to the Swift environment is to update the configuration
        files. Follow these steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Log in to the lifecycle manager.</li>
        <li>Set the weight-step attribute, as needed, for the nodes you are altering. (For
          instructions, see <xref href="swift_weight_attribute.dita"/>). </li>
        <li>Edit the configuration files as part of the Input Model as appropriate. (For general
          information about the Input Model, see <xref
            href="../../architecture/input_model/configobj/networks.dita"/>. For more specific
          information about the Swift parts of the configuration files, see <xref
            href="../../planning/objectstorage/swift_input_model.dita"/>) </li>
        <li>Once you have completed all of the changes, commit your configuration to the local git
          repository. (For more information, see<xref
            href="../../installation/using_git.dita#using_git"/>.)
          :<codeblock>git add -A
git commit -m "commit message"</codeblock></li>
        <li>Run the configuration
          processor:<codeblock>cd ~/helion/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost config-processor-run.yml</codeblock></li>
        <li>Create a deployment
          directory:<codeblock>cd ~/helion/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost ready-deployment.yml</codeblock></li>
        <li>Run the Swift playbook that will validate your configuration files and give you a report
          as an
          output:<codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts swift-compare-model-rings.yml</codeblock></li>
        <li>Use the report to validate that the number of drives proposed to be added or deleted, or
          the weight change, is correct. Fix any errors in your input model. At this stage, no
          changes have been made to rings.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>
    <section id="first_rebalance"><title>First phase of Ring Rebalance</title>
      <p>To begin the rebalancing of the Swift rings, follow these steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>After going through the steps in the section above, deploy your changes to all of the
          Swift nodes in your environment by running this
          playbook:<codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts swift-deploy.yml </codeblock></li>
        <li>Wait until replication has finished or <codeph>min-part-hours</codeph> has elapsed
          (whichever is longer). For more information, see <xref
            href="safe_rebalance_deploy_ring.dita#topic_ohx_j1t_4t"/></li>
      </ol>
    </section>
    <section id="weight_change"><title>Weight Change Phase of Ring Rebalance</title>
      <p>At this stage, no changes have been made to the input model. However, when you set the
          <codeph>weight-step</codeph> attribute, the rings that were rebuilt in the previous
        rebalance phase have weights that are different than their target/final value. You gradually
        move to the target/final weight by rebalancing a number of times as described on this page.
        For more information about the weight-step attribute, see <xref
          href="swift_weight_attribute.dita"/>.</p>
      <p>To begin the re-balancing of the rings, follow these steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Rebalance the rings by running the
          playbook:<codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts swift-update-from-model-rebalance-rings.yml</codeblock></li>
        <li>Run the
          reconfiguration:<codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts swift-reconfigure.yml</codeblock></li>
        <li>Wait until replication has finished or <codeph>min-part-hours</codeph> has elapsed
          (whichever is longer). For more information, see <xref
            href="safe_rebalance_deploy_ring.dita#topic_ohx_j1t_4t"/></li>
        <li>Run the following command and review the
            report:<codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts swift-compare-model-rings.yml --limit SWF*</codeblock><p>The
            following is an example of the output after executing the above command. In the example
              <b>no</b> weight changes are
            proposed:<codeblock>TASK: [swiftlm-ring-supervisor | validate-input-model | Print report] ********* 
ok: [padawan-ccp-c1-m1-mgmt] => {
    "var": {
        "report.stdout_lines": [
            "Need to add 0 devices", 
            "Need to remove 0 devices", 
            "<b>Need to set weight on 0 devices</b>"
        ]
    }
}</codeblock></p></li>
        <li>When there are no proposed weight changes, you proceed to the final phase.</li>
        <li>If there are proposed weight changes repeat this phase again. </li>
      </ol>
    </section>
    <section id="final_rebalance"><title>Final Rebalance Phase</title>
      <p>The final rebalance phase moves all replicas to their final destination.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Rebalance the rings by running the playbook:
            <codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts swift-update-from-model-rebalance-rings.yml | tee /tmp/rebalance.log</codeblock><note>The
            output is saved for later reference.</note></li>
        <li>Review the output from the previous step. If the output for all rings is similar to the
          following, the rebalance had no effect. That is, the rings are balanced and no further
          changes are needed. In addition, the ring files were not changed so you do not need to
          deploy them to the Swift
            nodes:<codeblock>"Running: swift-ring-builder /etc/swiftlm/builder_dir/region-region1/account.builder rebalance 999", 
      "NOTE: No partitions could be reassigned.", 
      "Either none need to be or none can be due to min_part_hours [16]."</codeblock><p>The
            text <b>No partitions could be reassigned</b> indicates that no further rebalances are
            necessary. If this is true for all the rings, you have completed the final
              phase.<note>You must have allowed enough time to elapse since the last rebalance. As
              mentioned in the above example, <codeph>min_part_hours [16]</codeph> means that you
              must wait at least 16 hours since the last rebalance. If not, you should wait until
              enough time has elapsed and repeat this phase.</note></p></li>
        <li>Run the <codeph>swift-reconfigure.yml</codeph>
          playbook:<codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts swift-reconfigure.yml</codeblock></li>
        <li>Wait until replication has finished or <codeph>min-part-hours</codeph> has elapsed
          (whichever is longer). For more information see <xref
            href="safe_rebalance_deploy_ring.dita#topic_ohx_j1t_4t"/></li>
        <li>Repeat the above steps until the ring is rebalanced.</li>

              <entry><p>When a drive fails, replace it as soon as possible. Do not attempt to remove
                  it from the ring - this creates operator overhead. Swift will continue to store
                  the correct number of replicas by handing off objects to other drives instead of
                  the failed drive.</p>If the disk drives are of the same size as the original when
                the drive is replaced, no ring changes are required. You can confirm this by running
                the <codeph>swift-update-from-model-rebalance-rings.yml</codeph> playbook. It should
                report that no weight changes are needed. <p>For a single drive replacement, even if
                  the drive is significantly larger than the original drives, you do not need to
                  rebalance the ring (however, the extra space on the drive will not be
                used).</p></entry>

              <entry>Upgrading Disk Drives</entry>
              <entry>
                <p>If the drives are different size (for example, you are upgrading your system),
                  you can proceed as follows:</p>
                <ul id="ul_smv_pfz_4t">
                  <li>If not already done, set the weight-step attribute</li>
                  <li>Replace drives in phases:<ul id="ul_gvy_5fz_4t">
                      <li>Avoid replacing too many drives at once.</li>
                      <li>If your rings use swift zones, upgrade a number of drives in the same zone
                        at the same time - not drives in several zones.</li>
                      <li>It is also safer to upgrade one server instead of drives in several
                        servers at the same time.</li>
                      <li>Remember that the final size of all Swift zones must be the same, so you
                        may need to replace a small number of drives in one zone, then a small
                        number in second zone, then return to the first zone and replace more
                        drives, etc. </li>
