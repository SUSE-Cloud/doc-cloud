    Recovery</title>

    <p>This scenario makes the following assumptions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your lifecycle manager is still intact and working.</li>
      <li>One or two of your controller nodes went down, but not the entire cluster.</li>
      <li>The node needs to be rebuilt from scratch, not simply rebooted.</li>
    </ul>

      <title>Steps to recovering one or two controller nodes</title>
      <ol>
        <li>Ensure that your node has power and all of the hardware is functioning.</li>
        <li>Log in to the lifecycle manager.</li>
        <li>Verify that all of the information in your
            <codeph>~/helion/my_cloud/definition/data/servers.yml</codeph> file is correct for your
          controller node. You may need to replace the existing information if you had to either
          replacement your entire controller node or just pieces of it.</li>
        <li>If you made changes to your <codeph>servers.yml</codeph> file then commit those changes
          to your local git:
          <codeblock>git add -A
git commit -a -m "editing controller information"</codeblock></li>
        <li>Run the configuration processor:
          <codeblock>cd ~/helion/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost config-processor-run.yml</codeblock></li>
        <li>Update your deployment directory:
          <codeblock>cd ~/helion/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost ready-deployment.yml</codeblock></li>
        <li>Ensure that Cobbler has the correct system information: <ol>
            <li>If you replaced your controller node with a completely new machine, you need to
              verify that Cobbler has the correct list of controller nodes:
              <codeblock>sudo cobbler system list</codeblock></li>
            <li>Remove any controller nodes from Cobbler that no longer exist:
              <codeblock>sudo cobbler system remove --name=&lt;node></codeblock></li>
            <li>Add the new node into Cobbler:
              <codeblock>cd ~/helion/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost cobbler-deploy.yml</codeblock></li>
          </ol></li>
        <li>Then you can image the node:
            <codeblock>cd ~/helion/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost bm-reimage.yml -e nodelist=&#60;node_name></codeblock><note>If
            you don't know the <codeph>&#60;node name></codeph> already, you can get it by using
              <codeph>sudo cobbler system list</codeph></note><p>Before proceeding, you may want to
            take a look at <b>info/server_info.yml</b> to see if the assignment of the node you have
            added is what you expect. It may not be, as nodes will not be numbered consecutively if
            any have previously been removed. This is to prevent loss of data; the config processor
            retains data about removed nodes and keeps their ID numbers from being reallocated. See
            the Persisted Server Allocations section in <xref
              keyref="persisteddata/persistedserverallocations">Input Model</xref> for information
            on how this works.</p></li>
        <li>[OPTIONAL] - Run the <codeph>wipe_disks.yml</codeph> playbook to ensure all of your
          partitions on your nodes are completely wiped prior to continuing with the installation:
          <codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible/
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts wipe_disks.yml --limit &#60;controller_node_hostname></codeblock></li>
        <li>Complete the rebuilding of your controller node with the two playbooks
          below:<codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts osconfig-run.yml -e rebuild=True --limit=&lt;controller_node_hostname>
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts hlm-deploy.yml -e rebuild=True --limit=&lt;controller_node_hostname></codeblock></li>
      </ol>
