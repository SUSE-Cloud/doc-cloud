    <section><title>Integrating with an external LDAP server</title>
      <p/><p>The Keystone identity service provides two primary functions: user authentication and
        access authorization. The user authentication function validates a user's identity. Keystone
        has a very basic user management system that can be used to create and manage user login and
        password credentials but this system is intended only for proof of concept deployments due
        to the very limited password control functions. The internal identity service user
        management system is also commonly used to store and authenticate OpenStack-specific service
        account information.</p><p>The recommended source of authentication is external user
        management systems such as LDAP directory services. The identity service can be configured
        to connect to and use external systems as the source of user authentication. The identity
        service domain construct is used to define different authentication sources based on domain
        membership. For example, cloud deployment could consist of as few as two domains:</p>
      <ul id="ul_msq_q3h_4v">
        <li>The default domain that is pre-configured for the service account users that are
          authenticated directly against the identity service internal user management system</li>
        <li>A customer-defined domain that contains all user projects and membership definitions.
          This domain can then be configured to use an external LDAP directory such as Microsoft
          Active Directory as the authentication source.</li>
      </ul><p><keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> can support multiple domains for deployments that support
        multiple tenants. Multiple domains can be created with each domain configured to either the
        same or different external authentication sources. This deployment model is known as a
        "per-domain" model.</p><p>There are currently two ways to configure "per-domain"
        authentication sources:</p><ul id="ul_nsq_q3h_4v">
        <li>File store – each domain configuration is created and stored in separate text files.
          This is the older and current default method for defining domain configurations. </li>
        <li>Database store – each domain configuration can be created using either the identity
          service manager utility (recommenced) or a <xref
            href="http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref-identity-v3.html#domains-config-v3"
            format="html"  >Domain Admin API</xref> (from OpenStack.org), and the
          results are stored in the identity service MySQL database. This database store is a new
          method introduced in the OpenStack Kilo release and now available in <keyword
            keyref="kw-hos-phrase-30"/>.</li>
      </ul><p>Instructions for initially creating per-domain configuration files and then migrating
        to the Database store method via the identity service manager utility are provided as
        follows.</p>
      
      <note type="important">We do not support enabling LDAP connection pool (i.e. use_pool: True)
        due to an upstream bug. The <b>use_pool</b> parameter must be present and must set to
          <b>False</b>.</note>
      
      <p id="filestore"><b>Set up domain-specific driver configuration - file store </b></p> To
      update configuration to a specific LDAP domain: <ol>
        <li> Ensure that the following configuration options are in the main configuration file
          template: /home/stack/helion/my_cloud/config/keystone/keystone.conf.j2
          <codeblock>[identity]
          domain_specific_drivers_enabled = True
          domain_configurations_from_database = False</codeblock>
        </li>
        <li>Create a YAML file that contains the definition of the LDAP server connection. The
          sample file below is already provided as part of the lifecycle manager in the <xref
            href="../../../installation/using_git.xml#using_git">local git repository</xref>. It is
          available on the lifecycle manager in the following file:
            <codeblock>/home/stack/helion/my_cloud/config/keystone/keystone_configure_ldap_sample.yml</codeblock><p>Save
            a copy of this file with a new name, for example:</p>
          <codeblock>/home/stack/helion/my_cloud/config/keystone/keystone_configure_ldap_my.yml</codeblock>

    <section><title>Set up or switch to domain-specific driver configuration using a database
        store</title>To set up domain-specific driver configuration using a database store, you will
      first need to execute the steps to create the domain-specific driver configuration using a
      file store, as shown above. Then switch to the database store. Once switched, all of the
      domain-specific driver configuration files will be ignored by the system. No mix of file and
      database stores is supported for a domain. </section>
    <section>To make the switch, execute the steps below. Remember, you must have already set up the
      configuration for a file store as explained in the section on <xref href="#ldap/filestore"
        format="dita">domain-specific driver configuration - file store</xref>, and it must be
      working properly. <ol id="ol_sff_px4_mv">
        <li> Ensure that the following configuration options are set in the main configuration file,
          /home/stack/helion/my_cloud/config/keystone/keystone.conf.j2:
          <codeblock>[identity]
domain_specific_drivers_enabled = True
domain_configurations_from_database = True
      
[domain_config]
driver = sql</codeblock>
        </li>
        <li>Once the template is modified, commit the change to the local git repository, and rerun
          the configuration processor / deployment area preparation playbooks (as suggested at Using
          Git for Configuration Management):
          <codeblock>$ cd ~/helion
$ git checkout site
$ git add -A</codeblock> Verify that the
          files have been added using git status: <codeblock>$ git status</codeblock> Then commit
          the changes:
          <codeblock>$ git commit -m "Use Domain-Specific Driver Configuration - Database Store: more description here..."</codeblock>
          Next, run the configuration processor and ready deployment playbooks:
          <codeblock>$ cd ~/helion/hos/ansible
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost config-processor-run.yml
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost ready-deployment.yml</codeblock>

        <li>Run the reconfiguration playbook in a deployment area:
          <codeblock>$ cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts keystone-reconfigure.yml</codeblock>
        </li>
        <li>Upload the domain-specific config files to the database if they have not been loaded. If
          they have already been loaded and you want to switch back to database store mode, then
          skip this upload step and move on to step 5. <ol id="ol_tff_px4_mv">
            <li> Go to one of the controller nodes where Keystone is deployed. </li>
            <li>Verify that domain-specific driver configuration files are located under the

                </li>
                <li>Option 2: Upload individual domain-specific configuration files by specifying

                  that the Keystone manager utility doesn't upload the domain-specific driver
                  configuration file the second time for the same domain. For the management of the
                  domain-specific driver configuration in the database store, you may refer to <xref

    <section><title>Update LDAP CA certificates</title>There is a chance that LDAP CA certificates
      may expire or for some reason not work anymore. Below are steps to update the LDAP CA
      certificates on the identity service side. Follow the steps below to make the updates.<ol>
        <li> Locate the file keystone_configure_ldap_certs_sample.yml
          <codeblock>/home/stack/helion/my_cloud/config/keystone/keystone_configure_ldap_certs_sample.yml</codeblock>
        </li>

          <codeblock>/home/stack/helion/my_cloud/config/keystone/keystone_configure_ldap_certs_all.yml</codeblock>
        </li>
        <li>Edit the file and specify the correct single file path name for the ldap certificates.
          This file path name has to be consistent with the one defined in tls_cacertfile of the
          domain-specific configuration. Edit the file and populate or update it with LDAP CA
          certificates for all LDAP domains. </li>
        <li>As suggested in <xref href="../../../installation/using_git.xml#using_git">Using Git
            for Configuration Management</xref>, add the new file to the local git
          repository:<codeblock>$ cd ~/helion
$ git checkout site

          that the files have been added using git status and commit the
          file:<codeblock>$ git status
$ git commit -m "Update LDAP CA certificates: more description here..."</codeblock>
          Then run the configuration processor and ready deployment playbooks:
          <codeblock>$ cd ~/helion/hos/ansible
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost config-processor-run.yml
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost ready-deployment.yml</codeblock>

            configuration in a single identity service instance. Once a database store is enabled
            within the identity service instance, any file store will be ignored, and vice versa. </li>
          <li>The identity service allows a list limit configuration to globally set the maximum

        <note>When integrating with an external identity provider, cloud security is dependent upon
          the security of that identify provider. You should examine the security of the identity
          provider, and in particular the SAML 2.0 token generation process and decide what security
          properties you need to ensure adequate security of your cloud deployment. More information
          about SAML can be found at <xref
