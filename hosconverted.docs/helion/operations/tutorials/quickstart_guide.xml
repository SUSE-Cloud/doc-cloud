                installing and setting up a <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> cloud. Use this quickstart
                guide to build testing, demonstration, and lab-type environments, rather than
                production installations. When you complete this quickstart process, you will have a

            <p>The following are short descriptions of the components that <keyword keyref="kw-hos"
                /> employs when installing and deploying your cloud.</p>
            <p/>
            <sectiondiv><b>Ansible</b><p>Ansible is a powerful configuration mangament tool used by
                        <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> to manage nearly all aspects of your cloud
                    infrastructure. Most commands in this quickstart guide execute Ansible scripts,
                    known as playbooks. You will run playbooks that install packages, edit
                    configuration files, manage network settings, and take care of the general
                    administration tasks required to get your cloud up and running. </p><p>Get more
                    information on Ansible at <xref href="https://www.ansible.com/" format="html"
                        scope="external"/>.</p><p/></sectiondiv>
            <sectiondiv><b>Cobbler</b><p>Cobbler is another third-party tool used by Helion
                    OpenStack to deploy operating systems across the physical servers that make up
                    your cloud. Find more info at <xref href="http://cobbler.github.io/"
                        format="html" scope="external"/>.</p><p/></sectiondiv>
            <sectiondiv><b>Git</b><p>Git is the version control system used to manage the
                    configuration files that define your cloud. Any changes made to your cloud
                    configuration files must be committed to the locally hosted git repository to
                    take effect. Read more information on Git at <xref href="https://git-scm.com/"

                in place before rolling out your cloud. Most importantly, a basic <keyword
                    keyref="kw-hos"/> cloud requires the proper network infrastrucure. Because
                    <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> segregates the network traffic of many of its
                elements, if the necessary networks, <?oxy_comment_start author="mwelch" timestamp="20160827T234509-0700" comment="Did you mean routers?" id="skl_qww_cx" mid="3"?><?oxy_comment_start author="jfrench" timestamp="20160829T162638-0700" comment="Routes implies router(s).

            <p>When your network infrastructure is in place, go ahead and set up the lifecycle
                manager. This is the server that will orchestrate the deployment of the rest of your
