      <para>This document provides simplified
                instructions
                 for
                installing and setting up a <phrase/> cloud. Use this quickstart
                guide to build testing, demonstration, and lab-type environments, rather than
                production installations. When you complete this quickstart process, you will have a
                fully functioning <phrase/> demo environment.</para>

      <para>Successfully deploying a <phrase/> cloud environment is a large but
                not complicated endeavor. For a successful deployment, you must put a number of
                components
                in place before rolling out your cloud. Most importantly, a basic <phrase/> cloud requires the proper network infrastrucure. Because
                    <phrase/> segregates the network traffic of many of its
                elements, if the necessary networks, routes,
                and firewall access rules aren't in place, communication required
                for a successful deployment will not occur.</para>

      <para>When your network infrastructure is in place, go ahead and set up the lifecycle
                manager. This is the server that will orchestrate the deployment of the rest of your
                cloud. It's also the server you will run most of your deployment and management
                commands on.</para>
