      <para>This operation should be used rarely and for good reason.</para>

      <para>If the host running the <literal>cinder-volume</literal> service fails for any reason it
        should be restarted as quickly as possible. Often the host running Cinder services also runs
        high availability (HA) services such as MySQL and RabbitMQ. These HA services are at risk
        while one of the nodes in the cluster is down. If it will take a significant amount of time
        to recover the failed node, then you may migrate the <literal>cinder-volume</literal> service
        to one of the other controller nodes. When the node has been recovered you should migrate
        the <literal>cinder-volume</literal> service back to the original (default) node.</para>
