   <title>Metric Performance Considerations</title>
        <para>Collecting metrics on your virtual machines can greatly affect performance. <phrase/> supports 200 compute nodes, with up to 40 VMs each. If your
            environment is managing maximum number of VMs, adding a single metric for all VMs is the
            equivalent of adding 8000 metrics. If too many metrics are added, you may exceed the
            Vertica database license.</para>
        <para>Because of the potential impact that new metrics have on system performance, consider
            adding only new metrics that are useful for alarm-definition, capacity planning, or
            debugging process failure.</para>
