      <phrase/>Configuring Load Balancing as a Service

    <para><emphasis role="bold">
         <phrase/> LBaaS Configuration</emphasis></para>

    <para> Load Balancing as a Service (LBaaS) is an advanced networking service that allows load
      balancing of multi-node environments. It provides the ability to spread requests across
      multiple servers thereby reducing the load on any single server. This document describes the
      installation steps for LBaaS v1 (see prerequisites) and the configuration for LBaaS v1 and
      v2.</para>


    <para><phrase/> can support either LBaaS v1 or LBaaS v2 to allow for wide
      ranging customer requirements. If the decision is made to utilize LBaaS v1 it is highly
      unlikely that you will be able to perform an on-line upgrade of the service to v2 after the
      fact as the internal data structures are significantly different. Should you wish to attempt
      an upgrade support will be needed from Helion Professional Services and your chosen load
      balancer partner.</para>


    
    
    

    <para>LBaaS V2 offers with <citetitle>FIXME: broken external xref</citetitle> a
      software load balancing solution that supports both a highly available control plane and data
      plane. However, should an external hardware load balancer be selected the cloud operation can
      achieve additional performance and availability.</para>

      <para>Only LBaaS V2 API currently supports load balancer failover with Octavia. However, in
      LBaaS V1 and if Octavia is not deployed when a load balancer is deleted it will need to be
      manually recreated. LBaaS v2 API includes automatic failover of a deployed load balancer with
      Octavia. More information about this driver can be found at <citetitle>FIXME: broken external xref</citetitle></para>

      <important>
         <para>It is not recommended that LBaaS v1 is used in a production
        environment. It is recommended you use LBaaS v2. If you do deploy LBaaS v1, the upgrade to
        LBaaS v2 is non-trivial and may require the use of professional services.</para>

      </important>
      <note>
         <para>If you need to run LBaaS v1 instead of the default LBaaS v2, you should make appropriate
        installation preparations during <phrase/> installation since LBaaS v2 is
        the default. If you have selected to install and use LBaaS v1 you will replace the
        control_plane.yml directories and neutron.conf.j2 file to use version 1. </para>

      </note>
      <para>Before you modify the control_plane.yml file, it is recommended that you back up the
        original version of this file. Once you have backed them up, modify the control_plane.yml
        file.</para>
