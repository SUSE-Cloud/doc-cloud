      <phrase/>Replacing a Controller Node</title>
    
    <para/>
    
    <para>For <phrase/> versions, you must have three controller nodes.
      Therefore, adding or removing nodes is not an option. However, if you need to repair or
      replace a controller node, you may do so by following the steps outlined here. Note that to
      run any playbooks whatsoever for cloud maintenance, you will always run the steps from the
      lifecycle manager.</para>
    <para>These steps will depend on whether you need to replace a shared lifecycle manager/controller
      node or whether this is a standalone controller node.</para>
