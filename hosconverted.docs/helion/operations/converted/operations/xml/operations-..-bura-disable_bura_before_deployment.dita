      <phrase/>Disabling Backup/Restore before Deployment</title>
    
    
    <para>Backups are enabled by default. Therefore, you must take action if you want backups to
      be disabled for any reason. This topic explains how to disable default backup jobs before
      completing the installation of your cloud. </para>

   <caution>
      <para>You should make modifications
        in the <literal>~/helion/my_cloud/</literal> directory before running the configuration
        processor and ready-deployment steps.</para>

   </caution>
    
      <bridgehead renderas="sect4">Disable backups before installation:</bridgehead>
      <para>To disable deployment of the Freezer backup and restore service, remove the following lines
        in <literal>control_plane.yml</literal>:</para>

      <note>
         <para>This action is required even if you already removed Freezer lines from your model
          (<literal>control_plane.yml</literal>).</para>

      <para>It is also possible to allow Freezer deployment yet prevent the lifecycle manager from
        creating automatic backup jobs. By default, the lifecycle manager deployment automatically
        creates jobs for the backup and restore of the following: </para>

      <para>Before running the configuration processor, you can prevent Freezer from automatically
        creating backup and restore jobs by changing the variables
          <literal>freezer_create_backup_jobs</literal> and
          <literal>freezer_create_restore_jobs</literal> to <literal>false</literal> in:
        </para>
<screen>~/helion/my_cloud/config/freezer/activate_jobs.yml</screen>

      <para>Alternatively, you can disable the creation of those jobs while launching the deployment
        process, as
        follows:</para>
<screen>ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts site.yml -e '{ "freezer_create_backup_jobs": false }' -e '{ "freezer_create_restore_jobs": false }'</screen>

      <para>When using these options, the Freezer infrastructure will still be deployed but will not
        execute any backups.</para>

   
    
      <bridgehead renderas="sect4">Disable backup and restore jobs for a specific service</bridgehead>
      <para>To manage which
      jobs will be enabled, set the appropriate paramters in the <literal>jobs.yml</literal> freezer
      jobs configuration file: </para>

      <screen>/helion/my_cloud/config/freezer/jobs.yml</screen>
      <para>You
      can completely disable the backup of a component by changing the <literal>enabled</literal>
      field that corresponds to that service to false in <literal>jobs.yml</literal>.</para>

      <para>You can
        specify where a job will store its backup by setting <literal>store_in_swift,
          store_in_ssh</literal>, <literal>store_in_local</literal> to true or false. Note that these
        are not mutually exclusive. You can set true for all of these backup targets. Setting SSH,
        Swift, and local to true will cause one backup job (and one restore job) per storage target
        to be created.</para>

      <para>Note also that even if <literal>store_in_ssh</literal> is set to true, the
      SSH backup job won't be created unless SSH credentials are provided in
        <literal>/helion/my_cloud/config/freezer/ssh_credentials.yml</literal>.</para>

      <para>When setting
          <literal>store_in_local</literal> to <literal>true</literal>, the backup job will store
        backups on the server executing the backup. This option is useful, for example, if you plan
        to mount an NFS share and want your backup stored on it. You need to provide the path where
        the backup will be stored by setting the <literal>local_storage_base_dir</literal> parameter.
      </para>

      <para>By default, one backup job per storage medium per component will be created. A
      corresponding restore job for each of those backup jobs will also be created by default. These
      jobs can be used to quickly restore the corresponding backup. To disable the creation of these
      restore jobs, change <literal>also_create_restore_job</literal> to
      <literal>false</literal>.</para>
