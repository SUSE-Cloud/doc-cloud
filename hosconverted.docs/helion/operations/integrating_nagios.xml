      <p><keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> cloud operators that are using Nagios or Icinga-based monitoring
        systems may wish to integrate them with the built-in monitoring infrastructure of HPE Helion
        OpenStack. Integrating with the existing monitoring processes and procedures will reduce
        support overhead and avoid duplication. This document describes the different approaches
        that can be taken to create a well-integrated monitoring dashboard using both
        technologies.</p>
      <p><note>This document refers to Nagios but the proposals will work equally well with Icinga,
          Icinga2, or other Nagios clone monitoring systems.</note></p>

    <section id="monitoring_overview">
      <title><keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> monitoring and reporting</title>
      <p><keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> comes with a monitoring engine (Monasca) and a separate
        management dashboard (Operations Console). Monasca is extremely scalable, designed to cope
        with the constant change in monitoring sources and services found in a cloud environment.
        Monitoring agents running on hosts (physical and virtual) submit data to the Monasca message
        bus via a RESTful API. Threshold and notification engines then trigger alarms when
        predefined thresholds are passed. Notification methods are flexible and extendible. Typical
        examples of notification methods would be emails generated or creating alarms in
        PagerDuty.</p>
      <p>While extensible, Monasca is largely focused on monitoring cloud infrastructures rather
        than traditional environments such as server hardware, network links, switches, etc. For
        more details about the monitoring service, see <xref href="monitoring.xml"/>.</p>
      <p>The Operations Console (Ops Console) provides cloud administrators a clear web interfaces
        to view alarm status, management alarm workflow, and configure alarms and thresholds. For
        more details about the Ops Console, see <xref href="opsconsole_overview.xml"/>.</p>

      <title>Nagios monitoring and reporting</title>
      <p>Nagios is an industry leading open source monitoring service with extensive plugins and
        agents. Nagios checks are either run directly from the monitoring server or run on a remote
        host via an agent and submit results back to the monitoring server. Whilst Nagios has proven
        itself as extremely flexible and scalable it requires significant explicit configuration.
        Using Nagios to monitor guest virtual machines becomes more challenging because virtual
        machines can be ephemeral which means new virtual machines are created and destroyed
        regularly. Configuration automation (Chef, Puppet, Ansible etc) can create a more dynamic
        Nagios setup but they still require the Nagios service to be restarted every time a new host
        is added.</p>
      <p>A key benefit of Nagios style monitoring is that it allows for <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/>
        to be monitored externally, from a user or service perspective. For example, checks can be
        created to monitor availability of all the API endpoints from external locations or even to
        create and destroy instances to ensure the entire system is working as expected.</p>

      <title>Summary</title>
      <p>We recognize that most private cloud operators already have existing monitoring solutions
        in place such as Nagios and Icinga. We recommend that you extend your existing solutions
        into Monasca or forward Monasca alerts to your existing solution to maximize coverage and
        reduce risk.</p>

    <section id="integration_approaches">
      <title>Integration Approaches</title>
      <p>Integration between Nagios and Monasca can occur at two levels, at the individual check
        level or at the management interfaces. Both options are discussed in the following
        sections.</p>
      <sectiondiv id="one">
        <p><b>Running Nagios-style checks in the Monasca agents</b></p>
        <p><image href="../../media/hos.docs/integrations/nagios/nagios_int1.png"/></p>
        <p>The Monasca agent is installed on all <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> servers and includes the
          ability to execute Nagios-style plugins as well as its own plugin scripts. For this
          configuration check, plugins need to be installed on the required server then added to the
          Monasca configuration under <codeph>/etc/monasca/agent/conf.d</codeph>. Care should be
          taken as plugins that take a long time (greater than 10 seconds) to run can result in the
          Monasca agent failing to run its own checks in the allotted time and therefore stopping
          all client monitoring. Issues have been seen with hardware monitoring plugins that can
          take greater than 30 seconds and any plugins relying on name resolution when DNS services
          aren’t available. Details on the required Monasca configuration can be found here: <xref
            href="https://github.com/openstack/monasca-agent/blob/master/docs/Plugins.md#nagios-wrapper"
            scope="external" format="html">Link</xref>.</p>
        <p>Use Case:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Local host checking. As an operator I want to run a local monitoring check on my host
            to check physical hardware. Check status and alert management will be based around the
            Ops Console, not Nagios.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Limitation</p>
        <ul>
          <li>As mentioned earlier, care should be taken to ensure checks don’t introduce load or
            delays in the Monasca agent check cycle. Additionally, depending on the operating system
            the node is running, plugins or dependencies may not be available.</li>
        </ul>
      </sectiondiv>
      <sectiondiv id="two">
        <p><b>Using Nagios as a central dashboard</b></p>
        <p><image href="../../media/hos.docs/integrations/nagios/nagios_int2.png"/></p>
        <p>It is possible to create a Nagios-style plugin that will query the Monasca API endpoint
          for an alarm status to create Nagios alerts and alarms based on Monasca alarms and
          filters. The following diagram demonstrates how the Monasca alarms appear in Nagios using
          two approaches, one listing checks by service and the other listing checks by physical
          host.</p>
        <p><image href="../../media/hos.docs/integrations/nagios/nagios.png"/></p>
        <p>In the top section, services have been created under a dummy host,
            <codeph>monasca_endpoint</codeph>. Each service retrieves all alarms based on defined
          dimensions, for example the <codeph>hos-compute</codeph> check will return all alarms with
          the compute (Nova) dimension.</p>
        <p>In the subsequent section, the physical servers making up the <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/>
          cluster have been defined and two checks are being run, one to check the server hardware
          from the Nagios server using a third party plugin and the second to retrieve all monasca
          alarms related to that host.</p>
        <p>To build this configuration, a custom Nagios plugin was created with the following
          options:</p>
        <codeblock>check_monasca –c &lt;credentials> -d &lt;dimension> -v &lt;value></codeblock>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <p>To check alarms on <codeph>test-ccp-comp001-mgmt</codeph> you would use:</p>
        <codeblock>check_monasca –c service.osrc –d hostname –v test-ccp-comp001-mgmt</codeblock>
        <p>To check all Network related alarms, you would use:</p>
        <codeblock>check_monasca –c service.osrc –d service –v networking</codeblock>
        <p>Use Cases:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Multiple clouds, integrating <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> monitoring with existing
            monitoring – viewing Monasca alerts in Nagios, fully integrating Monasca alarms with
            Nagios alarms and workflow.</li>
          <li>If you predominately use a Nagios or Icinga based monitoring environment, Monasca
            alarm status can be integrated into existing processes and workflows. This approach
            works best for checks associated with physical servers running the <keyword
              keyref="kw-hos"/> services.</li>
          <li>If you have multiple <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> clusters it allows all of their alarms
            to be consolidated into a single view, the current version of Ops Console if for a
            single cluster only.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Limitations</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Nagios has a more traditional configuration model that requires checks to belong to
            predefined services and hosts, this is not well suited in highly dynamic cloud
            environments where the lifespan of virtual instances can be very short. One possible
            solution is with Icinga2 which has an API available to dynamically add host and service
            definitions, the check plugin could be extended to create alarm definitions dynamically
            as they occur.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Disadvantages</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The key disadvantage is that multiple alarms can appear as a single service (e.g. in
            the screen shot above there are 3 warnings against one service. If an operator
            acknowledges this alarm and subsequently a 4th warning alarm occurs it wouldn’t generate
            an alert and could get missed.</li>
          <li>Care has to be taken that alarms aren’t missed. If the defined checks are only looking
            for checks in an ALARM status they won’t report undetermined checks that might indicate
            other issues.</li>
        </ul>
      </sectiondiv>
      <sectiondiv id="three">
        <p><b>Using Ops Console as central dashboard</b></p>
        <p><image href="../../media/hos.docs/integrations/nagios/nagios_int3.png"/></p>
        <p>Nagios has the ability to run custom scripts in response to events. It is therefore
          possible to write a plugin to update Monasca whenever a Nagios alert occurs. The Ops
          Console could then be used as a central reporting dashboard for both Monasca and Nagios
          alarms. The external Nagios alarms can have their own check dimension and could be
          displayed as a separate group in the Ops Console.</p>
        <p>Use Cases</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Using Ops Console the central monitoring tool.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Disadvantages</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The alarm could not be acknowledged from the Ops Console so Nagios could send
            repetitive notifications unless configured to take this into account.</li>
        </ul>
      </sectiondiv>
      <sectiondiv id="four">
        <p><b><keyword keyref="kw-hos"/>-specific Nagios Plugins</b></p>
        <p>Several OpenStack plugin packages exist (see <xref
            href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nagios-plugins-openstack" format="html"
            scope="external">here</xref>) that are useful to run from external sources to ensure the
          overall system is working as expect. Monasca requires some OpenStack components to be
          working in order to work at all. For example, if Keystone were unavailable then Monasca
          couldn't authenticate client or console requests. An external service check could
          highlight this.</p>

      <p><b>Alarm status differences</b></p>
      <p>Monasca and Nagios treat alarms and status in different ways and for the two systems to
        talk there needs to be a mapping between them. The following table details the alarm

Monasca ALARM ( HIGH ) -> Nagios Critical</codeblock>
      <p><b>Alarm workflow differences</b></p>
      <p>In both, system alarms can be acknowledged in the dashboards to indicate they are being
        worked on (or ignored). Not all the scenarios above will provide the same level of workflow
        integration.</p>
