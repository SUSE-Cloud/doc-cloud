      <p>Infrastructure resource quotas are also defined within the OpenStack cloud. Quotas are
        defined per service but can be assigned via the Horizon user interface in the Projects
        section; thus, this function is often associated with the Keystone API.
        <!--Insert screen shot of
        the Horizon interface used to configure upper limit quotas for specific
        infrastructure-related functions.-->
        Quotas are assigned per each project.</p>
      <p>Quotas can be managed using the CLI. Instructions can be found on OpenStack web site in
          <xref href="http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide-admin/cli_set_quotas.html" format="html"
           >Managing Quotas</xref></p>
      <p>In Horizon, the Managing Quotas panel provides a list of system quotas that you can view
        and edit, such as vCPU's, RAM and Storage.</p>
