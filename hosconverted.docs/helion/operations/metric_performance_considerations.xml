    <title>Metric Performance Considerations</title>
    <body>
        <p>Collecting metrics on your virtual machines can greatly affect performance. <keyword
                keyref="kw-hos-phrase"/> supports 200 compute nodes, with up to 40 VMs each. If your
            environment is managing maximum number of VMs, adding a single metric for all VMs is the
            equivalent of adding 8000 metrics. If too many metrics are added, you may exceed the
            Vertica database license.</p>
        <p>Because of the potential impact that new metrics have on system performance, consider
            adding only new metrics that are useful for alarm-definition, capacity planning, or
            debugging process failure.</p>
