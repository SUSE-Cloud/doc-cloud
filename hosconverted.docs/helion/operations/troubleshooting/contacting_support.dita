      <sectiondiv>
        <p><b>Call the HPE Support Number</b></p>
        <p>Once you have registered for HPE TS Support you will be mailed a Service Agreement ID
          (SAID) and a phone number to call (www.hpe.com/contact). HPE customers with a Datacenter
          Care for Cloud contract will have to use their designated contact number. You can use that
          phone number to log support requests. Please have your SAID number available when calling.
          The support agent will log a case with the information you provide and the case will be
          sent to the HPE TS Support Cloud CoE Team. The response time will depend on the service
          level agreement (SLA) in place.</p>
