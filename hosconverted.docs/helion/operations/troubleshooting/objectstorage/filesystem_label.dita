        the label before starting the upgrade.</note>

    <p>This topic describes how to check whether a file system in a partition has a label.</p>
    <p>To check whether a file system in a partition has a label, perform the following step:<ul
        id="ul_yzr_fz5_dt">
        <li>Log on to the server and execute the <codeph>xfs_admin</codeph> command (where
            <codeph>/dev/sdc1</codeph> is the partition where the file system is located):</li>
      </ul><codeblock>sudo xfs_admin -l /dev/sdc1</codeblock></p>
    <p>The output shows if a file system has a label. For example, this shows a label of
        <b>c0a8f502h000</b>:<codeblock>$ sudo xfs_admin -l /dev/sdc1
label = "<b>c0a8f502h000</b>"</codeblock>If
      no file system exists, the result is as
      follows:<codeblock>$ sudo xfs_admin -l /dev/sde1
xfs_admin: /dev/sde is not a valid XFS file system (unexpected SB magic number 0x00000000)</codeblock></p>
    <p>If you are about to install and deploy the system, you must delete the label before starting
      the deployment. As part of the deployment process, the system will label the partition.</p>
