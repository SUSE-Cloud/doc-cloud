        <section><title>New Alarms</title>
            <p>The New Alarms section shows you the alarms that have triggered since the timeframe
                indicated. You can select the timeframe using the <uicontrol>View</uicontrol>
                control with options ranging from the Last Minute to Last 30 Days. This section
                refreshes every 60 seconds.</p>
            <note>In later releases the refresh rate will vary based on the selected interval but it
                is a static time in this release.</note>
            <p>The new alarms will be separated into the following categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><uicontrol>Critical</uicontrol> - Open alarms, identified by red indicator.</li>
                <li><uicontrol>Warning</uicontrol> - Open alarms, identified by yellow
                    indicator.</li>
                <li><uicontrol>Unknown</uicontrol> - Open alarms, identified by gray indicator.
                    Unknown will be the status of an alarm that has stopped receiving a metric. This
                    can be caused by the following conditions: <ul>
                        <li>An alarm exists for a service or component that is not installed in the
                            environment.</li>
                        <li>An alarm exists for a virtual machine or node that previously existed
                            but has been removed without the corresponding alarms being
                            removed.</li>
                        <li>There is a gap between the last reported metric and the next
                            metric.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                <li><uicontrol>Open</uicontrol> - Complete list of open alarms.</li>
                <li><uicontrol>Total</uicontrol> - Complete list of alarms, may include Acknowledged
                    and Resolved alarms.</li>
