      <p><keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> DNS Service provides multi-tenant Domain Name Service with REST
        API management for domain and records. <note type="warning">The DNS Service is not intended
          to be used as an <b>internal</b> or <b>private</b> DNS service. The name records in DNSaaS
          should be treated as public information which anyone could query. There are controls to
          prevent tenants from creating records for domains they do not own. TSIG provides a
          transaction signature to ensure integrity during zone transfer to other DNS
          servers.</note>
