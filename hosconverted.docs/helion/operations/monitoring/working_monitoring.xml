    <p><b>Monasca-Agent</b></p>
    <p>The <b>monasca-agent</b> is a Python program that runs on the control plane nodes. It runs
      the defined checks and then sends data onto the API. The checks that the agent runs include: <ul>
        <li>System Metrics: CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O, network I/O, and filesystem
          utilization on the control plane and resource nodes.</li>
        <li>Service Metrics: the agent supports plugins such as MySQL, RabbitMQ, Kafka, and many
          others.</li>
        <li>VM Metrics: CPU utilization, disk I/O, network I/O, and memory usage of hosted virtual
          machines on compute nodes. Full details of these can be found <xref
