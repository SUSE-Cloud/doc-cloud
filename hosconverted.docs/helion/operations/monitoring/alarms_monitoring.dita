    <p><keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> comes with some predefined monitoring alarms for the services
      installed.</p>
    <p>Full details of all service alarms can be found here: <xref href="../alarm_resolutions.dita"
        >Service Alarm Definitions</xref>.</p>
    <p>Each alarm will have one of the following statuses: <ul>
        <li><uicontrol>Critical</uicontrol> - Open alarms, identified by red indicator.</li>
        <li><uicontrol>Warning</uicontrol> - Open alarms, identified by yellow indicator.</li>
        <li><uicontrol>Unknown</uicontrol> - Open alarms, identified by gray indicator. Unknown will
          be the status of an alarm that has stopped receiving a metric. This can be caused by the
          following conditions: <ul>
            <li>An alarm exists for a service or component that is not installed in the
              environment.</li>
            <li>An alarm exists for a virtual machine or node that previously existed but has been
              removed without the corresponding alarms being removed.</li>
            <li>There is a gap between the last reported metric and the next metric.</li>
          </ul></li>
        <li><uicontrol>Open</uicontrol> - Complete list of open alarms.</li>
        <li><uicontrol>Total</uicontrol> - Complete list of alarms, may include Acknowledged and
          Resolved alarms.</li>
      </ul></p>
    <p>When alarms are triggered it is helpful to review the service logs.</p>
