    <title>Integrating HipChat, Slack, and JIRA</title>
    <body>
        <p>Monasca, the <keyword keyref="kw-hos-phrase"/> monitoring and notification service,
            includes three default notification methods, <b>email</b>, <b>PagerDuty</b>, and
                <b>webhook</b>. Monasca also supports three other notification plugins which allow
            you to send notifications to <b>HipChat</b>, <b>Slack</b>, and <b>JIRA</b>. Unlike the
            default notification methods, the additional notification plugins must be manually
            configured.</p>
        <p>This guide details the steps to configure each of the three non-default notification
            plugins. This guide also assumes that your <keyword keyref="kw-hos-phrase"/> cloud is
            fully deployed and functional.</p>
