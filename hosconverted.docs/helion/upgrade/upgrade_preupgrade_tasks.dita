            <title>Preparing working loads before upgrading</title>
            <p>You should prepare your working loads before upgrading by consolidating all of your
                instances to one or more computes.  Once the upgrade is complete, reboot the empty computes
                and then move the images from the remaining non-rebooted computes to the newly
                booted computes.
