            <title>Preparing for Upgrade</title>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Read the <xref keyref="releasenotes50">Release Notes</xref>, especially the <xref keyref="knownissues50">Known Issues</xref> for the new version.</li>
                <li>Ensure you have a Backup strategy in place - see <xref keyref="bura_overview"/></li>
                <li>Ensure you have a known starting state by <xref keyref="alarm_resolutions">resolving any unexpected alarms</xref>.</li>
                <li>Determine if you will need to follow the procedure to <xref keyref="upgradeto50/rebooting_general">reboot your cloud</xref> after upgrading the software. In general, rebooting
                is only needed if the HPE Linux kernel has changed between versions. In the case of upgrade to <keyword keyref="kw-hos-version"/>, the kernel has changed
                and so a reboot is required.</li>
                <li>Review the configuration changes for DNS in the , <xref
                        keyref="designate_cfg_dns_ns"/> document.</li>
                
                <!--  Removed from HOS 5.0 since there are no changes from HOS 4.0 to HOS 5.0 in the Input Model.
                    <li>Read about the changes in the <xref keyref="input_model_changes40">Input Model</xref>. </li>
                 -->
                
                <li>Review steps in <xref
                        href="../operations/maintenance/networking/add_network_node.dita#add_network_node"
                    /> and <xref
                        href="../operations/maintenance/reboot_cloud_rolling.dita#rebootNodes"/>, to
                    minimize network traffic disruption affecting workloads. These steps are
                    especially critical in cases where the Neutron services are not provided via
                    external SDN controllers.</li>
                <li>Learn about <xref keyref="upgrade_deltas">Delta Upgrades</xref> and when you can  use them.</li>
