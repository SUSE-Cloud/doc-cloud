               <para>HPE customers who have purchased both <phrase/> and SLES
                            subscriptions with support from HPE will have one number to call for
                            troubleshooting, fault isolation and support from HPE technical support
                            specialists in <phrase/> and SUSE technologies. If the
                            problem is isolated to SLES software itself the issue will be replicated
                            on a SUSE certified platform and escalated to SUSE for resolution.

               <para>HPE will troubleshoot and fault isolate an issue at the Helion software

                            of the problem, then customers who did not purchase SLES support from
                            HPE will be directed to the vendor from whom they purchased SLES for
                            continued support. </para>
