      <para>The <phrase/> DNS Service supports several different backends for domain
        name service. The choice of backend must be included in the deployment model before the
          <phrase/> install is completed.  </para>
      <para>The backends that are available within the DNS Service are separated into two categories,
        self-contained and external.
