      <para>As part of the preparation to provision a RedHat compute node you need to be aware of the issues raised in this
                article and take any remedial action required.

      <bridgehead renderas="sect4">Sample iptables rules must be removed on RedHat</bridgehead>
      <para>
                <phrase/> uses iptables to secure access to lifecycle manager network interfaces and on 
                Red Hat this requires the package <literal>iptables-services</literal> to be installed.
                
                The package will provide sample iptables configurations for IPv4 and IPv6 if none existed before. 
                This sample configuration is inappropriate for <phrase/> operation and the node will not be able to run HOS 
                with these rules installed.
            </para>
      <para>
                The files installed are:

                If these files <emphasis role="bold">do not exist</emphasis> on the candidate Red Hat systems the rest of this note may be skipped as the 
                <phrase/> install will prevent the installation of the sample files.                
                However, if these files do exist, there are a number of steps that you must follow before you install <phrase/>.

                    interfaces not used by <phrase/>), you will need to reboot the system to activate the new settings.
