      <phrase/>Installing via the GUI </title>
    
    
    <para><phrase/> comes with a UI installer for installing your cloud
      the first time. Rather than searching through and editing a number of YAML files to input your
      specific configuration data, finding the correct location, and maintaining the format of the
      files, the UI presents fields in which you may enter your information. In addition, this
      latest version allows you to populate server information via a .csv file import.</para>

    <para>Using the installer, the series Cobbler and Ansible scripts that initiate the
      installation of <phrase/> are run for you behind the scenes. </para>

    <para>The UI app populates the configuration files that the configuration processor uses as
      input to its processes. Therefore you can inspect the files whenever you like, or before
      reconfiguring your cloud. </para>

    <para>Note, the GUI installer will periodically save the configuration files during the process
        and when you click the Deploy button at the end of the process. This also means that if you
        were to try to change anything in the files themselves mid process, the values would get
        overwritten by values you have entered in the GUI.</para>

    <para>These YAML configuration files are stored in a local git repository as well, as
      explained in <xref linkend="using_git"/>. </para>

   <para>When installing via the GUI, you begin with a model (or a cloud
        configuration template) and edit the contents to reflect your environment.</para>

   <para> However, the
      full range of customizations is not possible via the GUI as some configuration items are not
      exposed. Below is the list of what can and cannot be changed: </para>

          No action other than an understanding of your needs is necessary at this point. You will
          indicate which model you wish to deploy in a GUI screen. Note, however, that the only VSA
          options for the <emphasis>Entry-scale KVM with VSA</emphasis> model is to have 0 or 3 VSA nodes.
          
          Note also that you cannot run the lifecycle manager on a dedicated node using the GUI
          installer; it can only run in the control plane using the models exposed in the GUI.</para>

            <para>Before you use the GUI to install your cloud, you may install the operating system,
          Linux for HPE Helion, on your nodes (servers) if you prefer. Otherwise, the installer will
          install it for you. </para>

            <para>If you are installing the operating system on all your nodes
            yourself, note that you must do so using the Linux for HPE Helion image   that is
            included in the <phrase/> package. You may find the instructions
            on the following pages helpful even when using your own tools to install the operating

               <para>When following the guidance for operating system installation on those pages, stop
            before the sections for <emphasis role="bold">Running the configuration processor</emphasis>.
            The GUI installer will run those steps, and in
            the case where you have the GUI also install the operating systems, it will run all the
            previous steps (playbooks) as well.</para>

      You may create a CSV file for import into the GUI, indicating your server information rather

      <para>Here “OS Install Only?” indicates that this field is ONLY needed if you
        have indicated that you want the installer to install HPE Linux on the servers.</para>

      <para>The
        aliases are all the valid names that can be used in the CSV file for the column header for a
        given field. Note field names are not case sensitive and that you can use either ‘ ‘ (space)
        or ‘-‘ (hyphen) in place of underscore for a field name.</para>

      <para> So, an example header line
        in the CSV file could be:</para>

      <screen>Server ID, ip address, mac-address, IPMI_ip, password, user, server-role, server-GROUP, nic mapping</screen>

      <para> The order of the fields does NOT have to match the order in the table above.</para>

   
    
      <bridgehead renderas="sect4">Run the GUI to install your cloud</bridgehead>
      <para>The GUI is found on the lifecycle
      manager node at: <emphasis role="bold">http://&lt;lifecycle manager_IP&gt;:79/dayzero</emphasis></para>

      <para>To create a secure tunnel/port forwarding into Apache from the lifecycle manager to be able
        to use the GUI in a browser, SSH tunnel into the lifecycle manager with the
        username/password set up when installing the lifecycle manager. The username and password
        should be what was set in "Set up the lifecycle manager" in the installation instructions.
        For example:</para>

      <screen>ssh -v -N -L 8080:&lt;lifecycle manager_IP&gt;:79 &lt;Username&gt;@&lt;lifecycle manager_IP&gt;</screen>
      <para>Then on your local machine, the one you are tunneling from, point your web browser to:
          <emphasis role="bold">http://localhost:8080/dayzero</emphasis></para>

      <para>As you proceed through the GUI, you can either
      enter your server names and IP addresses manually or import them from the CSV file using the
      CSV fields described above.</para>

   
    <para>In the Assign network groups: External VM network fields, <emphasis role="bold">do not</emphasis> add entries for
      CIDR, Gateway, or IP Range, only VLAN ID. Neutron will assign these.</para>

   <para>When the installation
        is complete, the Ansible log will be displayed on the final page.</para>

    
      <bridgehead renderas="sect4">Use the installer securely</bridgehead>
      <para> The GUI installer is a web-based application that runs on the lifecycle manager node and
        is implemented in node.js. Currently this application runs behind Apache 2.0 where requests
        are proxied to the node.js Express Web Server. The node.js Express Server runs on port 3000
        and Apache runs on port 79. </para>

      <para>You should access the installer through Apache and not directly from the Express server. An
        Example URL looks like this: http://&lt;lifecycle manager-host-ip&gt;:79/dayzero When you
        finish installing, the Installer will be disabled via Ansible. It is also disabled once
        deployment is completed following the CLI instructions..</para>

   
    <para>The GUI is used only once: during the initial installation of your cloud.</para>

   <para>For VSA
        deployments, once the GUI competes its installation, you must follow the steps outlined in
        the <xref linkend="config_vsa"/>page.</para>

   <para>After
      deployment, you may also continue to <xref linkend="cloud_verification"/> and <xref linkend="postinstall_checklist"/>.</para>

   <note>
      <para>Because the GUI installer is disabled after deployment is complete, whether you installed
          your cloud via the GUI or via the command line, if you want to re-enable the GUI later but
          are not re-installing from scratch, run these commands:</para>
