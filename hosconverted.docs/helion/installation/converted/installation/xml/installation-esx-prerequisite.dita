         <para>Ensure that you have enabled HA (High Availability) and DRS (Distributed Resource
                Scheduler) settings in a cluster configuration before running the installation.
                DRS/HA is disabled only for OVSvApp. This is done so that it does not move to a
                different host. If you do not enable DRS/HA prior to installation then you will not
                be able to disable it only for OVSvApp. As a result DRS/HA can migrate OVSvApp to
                different host, which will create a network loop.</para>
         <note>
            <para>No two clusters should have
                    the same name across datacenters in a given vCenter.</para>
