      <phrase/>Using Git for Configuration Management</title>
    
    
    <para>In <phrase/>, a local git repository is used to track configuration
      changes and the configuration processor (CP) uses this repository. The introduction of a git
      workflow also means that your configuration history is maintained, making rollbacks easier as
      well as keeping a record of previous configuration settings.</para>

    <para>The git repository is installed by the lifecycle manager on the lifecycle manager node.</para>


    <para>The git repository provides a way for you to merge changes that you pull down as "upstream"
      (i.e. from HP) updates, and allows you to manage your own configuration changes. </para>

    
      <bridgehead renderas="sect4">Initialization on a new deployment</bridgehead>
      <para>On a system new to <phrase/>, the lifecycle manager will prepare a
        git repository under <literal>~/helion</literal>. The lifecycle manager provisioning runs the
          <literal>hlm-init-deployer</literal> script automatically - this calls
          <literal>ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost git-00-initialise.yml</literal>.</para>

      <para>As a result, the <literal>~/helion</literal> directory is initialized as a git repo (if it's
        empty). It is initialized with four empty branches: </para>

                  <para>This holds the upstream source code corresponding to the contents of the
                <literal>~/helion</literal> directory on a pristine fresh installation. Every source
              code release that is downloaded from HPE is applied as a fresh commit to this branch.
              This branch contains no customization by the end user.</para>

              that you commit your configuration changes. It's the branch most visible to the end

               <listitem>
                  <para>This branch contains the variable definitions generated by the CP that our main
              ansible playbooks need. This includes the <literal>verb_hosts</literal> file that
              describes to ansible what servers are playing what roles. The
                <literal>ready-deployment</literal> playbook takes this output and assembles a
                <literal>~/scratch</literal> directory containing the ansible playbooks together with
              the variable definitions in this branch. The result is a working ansible directory
                <literal>~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible</literal> from which the main deployment
              playbooks may be successfully run. </para>

                  <para>This branch contains the persistent state that the CP needs to maintain. That state
              is mostly the assignment of IP addresses and roles to particular servers. Some
              operational procedures may involve editing the contents of this branch: for example,
              retiring a machine from service or repurposing it.</para>
