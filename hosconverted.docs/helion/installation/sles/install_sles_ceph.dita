        <note type="warning">SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP2 comes with Ceph packages from the
        Ceph Jewel release. <keyword keyref="kw-hos-phrase"/> Ceph server is based on the Ceph
        Hammer release, therefore it is not advised that client related Ceph management commands
        from a SLES compute node be performed. Doing so could trigger an update of the Ceph config
        which would not be compatible with other non-SLES Ceph clients in the same <keyword
          keyref="kw-hos-phrase"/> system.
