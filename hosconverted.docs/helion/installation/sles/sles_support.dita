            <p>SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Host OS KVM and/or supported SLES guests have
                been tested and qualified by HPE to run on <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/>. Refer to the
                published compatibility matrix for your version of <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> at the
                following URL <xref href="http://docs.hpcloud.com/#home.html" format="html"
                    scope="external"/>. HPE is one of SUSE's largest OEMs with follow the sun global
                support coverage.</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>One Number to Call</b>
                        <p>HPE customers who have purchased both <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> and SLES
                            subscriptions with support from HPE will have one number to call for
                            troubleshooting, fault isolation and support from HPE technical support
                            specialists in <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> and SUSE technologies. If the
                            problem is isolated to SLES software itself the issue will be replicated
                            on a SUSE certified platform and escalated to SUSE for resolution.
                        </p></li>
                    <li><b>A Dual Support Model</b>
                        <p>HPE will troubleshoot and fault isolate an issue at the Helion software
                            level. If <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> software is excluded as the cause
                            of the problem, then customers who did not purchase SLES support from
                            HPE will be directed to the vendor from whom they purchased SLES for
                            continued support. </p></li>
