        <p>ESX/vCenter integration is not fully automatic, vCenter administrators are advised of the
            following responsibilities to ensure secure operation:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The VMware administrator is responsible for administration of the vCenter servers
                and the ESX nodes using the VMware administration tools. These responsibilities
                include: <ol>
                    <li>Installing and configuring vCenter server</li>
                    <li>Installing and configuring ESX server and ESX cluster</li>
                    <li>Installing and configuring shared datastores</li>
                    <li>Establishing network connectivity between the ESX network and the <keyword
                                keyref="kw-hos-tm"/>  management network</li>
                </ol></li>
            <li>The VMware administration staff is responsible for the review of vCenter logs. These
                    logs are not automatically included in <keyword keyref="kw-hos-tm"/> centralized
                    logging.</li>
            <li>The VMware administrator is responsible for administration of the vCenter servers
                and the ESX nodes using the VMware administration tools.</li>
            <li>Logging levels for vCenter should be set appropriately to prevent logging of the
                    password for the <keyword keyref="kw-hos-tm"/>  message queue.</li>
            <li>The vCenter cluster and ESX Compute nodes must be appropriately backed up.</li>
            <li>Backup procedures for vCenter should ensure that the file containing the <keyword
                        keyref="kw-hos-tm"/> configuration as part of Nova and Cinder volume
                    services is backed up and the backups are protected appropriately.</li>
            <li>Since the file containing the <keyword keyref="kw-hos-tm"/>  message queue password
                    could appear in the swap area of a vCenter server, appropriate controls should
                    be applied to the vCenter cluster to prevent discovery of the password via
                    snooping of the swap area or memory dumps</li>
            <li> It is recommended to have a common shared storage for all the ESXi hosts in a
                particular cluster. </li>
            <li>Ensure that you have enabled HA (High Availability) and DRS (Distributed Resource
                Scheduler) settings in a cluster configuration before running the installation.
                DRS/HA is disabled only for OVSvApp. This is done so that it does not move to a
                different host. If you do not enable DRS/HA prior to installation then you will not
                be able to disable it only for OVSvApp. As a result DRS/HA can migrate OVSvApp to
                different host, which will create a network loop.<note>No two clusters should have
                    the same name across datacenters in a given vCenter.</note></li>
            <li>L3 HA VRRP is enabled by default.</li>
