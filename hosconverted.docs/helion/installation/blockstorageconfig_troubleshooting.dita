      <p><b>Issue: You have forgotten the identifying information about your VSA cluster</b></p>
      <p>If you have forgotten the cluster name or IP address after creating the cluster in the CMC
        utility then you can perform the following steps to retrieve them:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Log in to CMC console using the <codeph>/opt/HP/StoreVirtual/UI/jre/bin/java -jar
            /opt/HP/StoreVirtual/UI/UI.jar</codeph> command from the lifecycle manager/deployer
          node.</li>
        <li>Log in to the Management group.</li>
        <li>On the left side of the CMC console screen, click <b>mgmt</b>. It expands and you will
          be able to see the cluster name.</li>
        <li>Click the cluster name. The page on the right hand side will populate with the cluster
          information.</li>
        <li>Click <codeph>iSCSI</codeph> on the right hand side of the page. The virtual IP address
          will be displayed in the tabular form. You can view your cluster ID here.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><b>Issue: Error During VSA Deployment Exhibits When Running site.yml or
        hlm-deploy.yml</b></p>
      <p>When you are running either <codeph>site.yml</codeph> or <codeph>hlm-deploy.yml</codeph>
        and you get either of the errors below during the VSA deployment task, there is an error in
        your locale settings.</p>
      <p>Errors:</p>

      <p>Fix:</p>
      <p>Make sure that the locale variables on the lifecycle manager are valid and then run the
