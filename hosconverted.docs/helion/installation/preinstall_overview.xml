            <p>Once you have an idea of the configuration you want to choose for your cloud and you have
                gone through the pre-installation steps, you have two options for installation. You can use
                a GUI that runs in your web browser or you can install via the command-line that exposes the
                full power and flexibility of <keyword keyref="kw-hos-phrase"/>.</p>
            <p><b>Using the GUI</b></p>
            <p>You should use the GUI if: <ul>
                    <li>You are not planning to deploy availability zones or use L3 segmentation in
                        your initial deployment. </li>
                <li>You are happy with the tuned HPE default OpenStack configurations.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Instructions for installing via the GUI are here.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><xref href="gui_installer.xml#install_gui">Installing via the GUI</xref></li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Note that reconfiguration of your cloud, at the moment, can only be done via the
                command-line. The GUI installer is for initial installation only. </p>
