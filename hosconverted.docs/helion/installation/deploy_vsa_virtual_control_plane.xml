            <keyword keyref="kw-hos-version"/> supports deployment of control plane elements on the
            virtual machines which can be co-located on the one baremetal machine or spread across
            the three baremetal machines. The baremetal machine in this context are termed as VM
            factory host(s). VSA can be deployed on the VM factory host. </p>
        <p>The following section illustrates the change in the input model for X1 and S1 model ONLY.
            The change in the input model for M1 model is similar except that VSA is deployed as the
            resource nodes. For other aspects of cluster management like upgrade, adding new set of
            disks, stopping and starting services and so on, you can follow the similar approach
            that is used for the deployment of ceph cluster using <keyword keyref="kw-hos-tm"/>.</p>
        <p>The HPE StoreVirtual Centralized Management Console (CMC) GUI is an interface where you
            can configure VSA. The following choices are available for deploying CMC with virtual
            control plane:<ol id="ol_srh_rbn_mx">
                <li>Deploy CMC on single VM factor host. You can access CMC by connecting to VM
                    factory host.</li>
                <li>Deploy CMC on single Controller. You can access CMC by connectiong to controller
                    node.</li>
            </ol></p>
        <section>Steps to deploy VSA on a VM factory host<ol id="ol_uqm_dcn_mx">
                <li>Log in to the lifecycle manager.</li>
                <li>Go to <codeph>~/helion/my_cloud/definition/</codeph>.<note>Assumptions is that
                        you have already copied cloud model representing contorl element depeloyment
                        on VM factory host(s).</note></li>
                <li>Edit your contorl plane (typically referenced in control_plane.yml) to add VSA
                    components to vmfactory nodes. For
                    example:<codeblock>  - name: vmfactory	
          resource-prefix: vmf	
          server-role: HLM-HYPERVISOR-ROLE	
          min-count:
          allocation-policy: strict	
          service-components: 	
            - ntp-server	
            - vsa
            - lifecycle-manager	
            - tempest	
            - openstack-client</codeblock></li>
                <li>Edit your contorl plane (typically referenced in control_plane.yml) to add CMC
                    component:    For CMC to be deployed on VMfactory node, add <b>cmc</b> in
                    vmfactory service-components. For
                        example:<codeblock> - name: vmfactory	
          resource-prefix: vmf	
          server-role: HLM-HYPERVISOR-ROLE	
          min-count:
          allocation-policy: strict	
          service-components: 	
            - ntp-server	
            - vsa
	    - cmc-service
            - lifecycle-manager	
            - tempest	
            - openstack-client</codeblock><p>For
                        CMC be deployed on Controller node, add <b>cmc</b> in controller
                        service-components. For
                        example:<codeblock> - name: cluster1
          cluster-prefix: c1
          server-role: CONTROLLER-ROLE
          member-count: 1
          allocation-policy: strict
          service-components:
            - ntp-server
            - cmc-service</codeblock></p></li>
                <li>Edit disks_vmfactory.yml file of VM factory hosts to define disks for VSA. For
                    e.g. the below disk model illustrates usage of <codeph>/dev/sdd</codeph> for
                    adaptive optimization, <codeph>/dev/sde</codeph> and <codeph>/dev/sdf</codeph>
