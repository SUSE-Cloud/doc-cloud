      <p><ul>
          <li>Your <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> cloud must be fully deployed using the a KVM cloud
            model with VSA added. The Entry-Scale KVM with VSA cloud model is an example of such a
            model. For more details on the installation refer to <xref href="installing_kvm.dita"
            />.</li>
          <li>It's important that all of your systems have the correct date/time because the HPE
            StoreVirtual VSA license has a start date. If the start date is later than the system
            time then the installation will fail.</li>

          <li>The license for the HPE StoreVirtual VSA license is bundled with <keyword
              keyref="kw-hos"/> and comes with a free trial which allows a maximum limit of 50 TB
            per node. Hence the total amount of the configured storage on an individual VSA node
            should not exceed 50 TB. To extend the 50 TB per node limit, you can add nodes. A VSA
            cluster can support up to 16 nodes, which means configured storage on a VSA cluster can
            be as much as 800 TB. <note type="notice">The HPE StoreVirtual VSA default license is
              for five (5) years with all supported functionality detailed above. During
              installation, the CMC utility may display a message that some features are not
              licensed. This message displays in error and can be ignored.</note>

            <p product="HOS">You can deploy VSA with Adaptive Optimization (AO) or without. The
              deployment process for each of these options is similar, you just need to make a

          <li>A single VSA node can have a maximum of seven raw disks (excluding the operating
            system disks) attached to it, which is defined in the disk input model for your VSA
            nodes. It is expected that no more than seven disks are specified (including Adaptive
            Optimization disks) per VSA node. For example, if you want to deploy VSA with two disks
            for Adaptive Optimization then your disk input model should not specify more than five
            raw disks for data and two raw disks for Adaptive Optimization. Exceeding the disk limit

      <p id="multibackend"><b>Concerning using multiple backends:</b> If you are using multiple
        backend options, ensure that you specify each of the backends you are using when configuring
        your <codeph>cinder.conf.j2</codeph> file using a comma delimited list. An example would be
          <codeph>enabled_backends=vsa-1,3par_iSCSI,ceph1</codeph> and is included in the steps
        below. You will also want to create multiple volume types so you can specify which backend
        you want to utilize when creating volumes. These instructions are included below as well. In
        addition to our documentation, you can also read the OpenStack documentation at <xref

      <p><b>VSA driver has updated name:</b> In the OpenStack Mitaka release, the VSA driver used
        for HPE Helion integration had its name updated from <codeph>hplefthand_</codeph> to
          <codeph>hpelefthand_</codeph>. To prevent issues when upgrading from previous <keyword
          keyref="kw-hos"/> releases, we left the names as-is in the release and provided a mapping
        so that the integration would continue to work. This will produce a warning in the
          <codeph>cinder-volume.log</codeph> file advising you of the deprecated name. The warning
        will look similar to
        this:<codeblock>Option "hplefthand_username" from group "&lt;your section>" is deprecated. Use option "hpelefthand_username" from group "&lt;your section>"
should be ignored.</codeblock></p>

      <title>Configure HPE StoreVirtual VSA</title>
      <p>The process for configuring HPE StoreVirtual VSA for <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> involves
        two major steps:</p>
      <p>
        <ul id="ul_kbm_n3k_5v">
          <li>Creating a cluster</li>
          <li>Configuring VSA as the block storage backend</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>You can perform these tasks in an automated process using the provided Ansible playbooks or
        manually using the HPE StoreVirtual Centralized Management Console (CMC) GUI.</p>
      <note>Using Ansible playbooks to create clusters is strongly recommended. Cluster creation
        using HPE StoreVirtual Centralized Management Console (CMC) GUI is deprecated in <keyword
          keyref="kw-hos-phrase"/>. Clusters created using CMC manually cannot be reconfigured using
        the Ansible playbooks. If you used CMC to create the clusters, you must continue to use CMC
        to administer those clusters.</note>
    </section>

    <section id="ansible"><title>Using Ansible</title>
      <p>Perform the following steps to create the cluster using the provided Ansible playbooks.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Log in to the lifecycle manager.</li>
        <li>Run the following playbook, which will both create your management group and your
          cluster:
          <codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible/
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts vsalm-configure-cluster.yml</codeblock></li>
        <li>When prompted, enter an administrative user name and password you will use to administer
          the CMC utility. <p>Administrative user naming requirements:</p><ul>
            <li>3 to 30 characters</li>
            <li>Must begin with a letter</li>
            <li>Allowed characters: 0-9, a-z, A-Z, hyphen (-), underline (_)</li>
            <li>Disallowed characters: Multibyte character set</li>
          </ul><p>Administrative user password requirements:</p><ul>
            <li>5 to 40 characters</li>
            <li>Must begin with a letter</li>
            <li>Many ASCII and extended ASCII characters, Multibyte character set</li>
            <li>Disallowed characters: dot (.), colon (:), forward slash (/), comma (,), backward
              slash (\), semi-colon (;), single-quote (â€˜), space ( ), equals (=)</li>
          </ul><note type="important">You will need to remember these values to access the cluster
            using the CMC utility or to re-run this playbook later if further management of your VSA
            system is needed. Do not change the credentials for one or more clusters using CMC as it
            will make the cluster automation playbook ignore those clusters for
            reconfiguration.</note></li>
        <li>In the output of the Ansible playbook you will see different steps where you can locate
          the values for your VSA cluster name, the virtual IP address, and the IP addresses of each
          of the VSA hosts in the cluster. You will use these values later when configuring your
            backend.<p>The following is an example, with the important information
            bolded.</p><p>This step displays the VSA cluster name and the virtual IP address of the

        <p id="launching-cmc-utility"><b>Launching the CMC utility GUI</b></p>
        <p>The HPE StoreVirtual Centralized Management Console (CMC) GUI is an interface where you
          can configure VSA. </p>
        <p>The CMC utility requires a GUI to access it. You can use either of the following methods
          to launch the CMC GUI.</p>
        <p>

        <p><b>RDP/VNC connect method</b></p>
        <p id="vnc">Setup VNC connect on the Controller Node</p>
        <p>The following steps will allow you to setup a VNC connect to your controller node so you
          can view the GUI.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Log in to your first controller node. </li>
          <li>Run the following command to install the package that is required to launch CMC:
            <codeblock>sudo apt-get install -y xrdp</codeblock></li>
          <li>Start <codeph>vnc4server</codeph> using the instructions below. You will be prompted
            for a password (min 6 characters). Enter a password and proceed. A sample output is
            shown below: <codeblock>stack@helion-cp1-c1-m1-mgmt:~$ vnc4server
            
You will require a password to access your desktops.

            <note>If you directly use xrdp to connect to the first controller node without using the
              VNC server then a remote session is created whenever you login. To avoid this, a
              dedicated VNC server instance is launched and connected to that instance by xrdp. This
              helps to maintain the session.</note></li>
          <li>Run <codeph>netstat -anp | grep vnc</codeph> to determine the public port that VNC is
            using. In the example below, the port is 5903: <codeblock>stack@helion-cp1-c1-m1-mgmt:~$ netstat -anp | grep vnc

      <title>Configure VSA as the Backend</title>
      <p>You will use the information you input to the CMC utility to configure your Cinder backend
        to use your VSA environment.</p>
      <p>To update your Cinder configuration to add VSA storage you must modify the
          <codeph>~/helion/my_cloud/config/cinder/cinder.conf.j2</codeph> file on your lifecycle
        manager as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Log in to the lifecycle manager.</li>
        <li>Make the following changes to the
            <codeph>~/helion/my_cloud/config/cinder/cinder.conf.j2</codeph> file: <ol>
            <li>Add your VSA backend to the <codeph>enabled_backends</codeph> section: <codeblock># Configure the enabled backends
enabled_backends=vsa-1</codeblock>
              <note type="important">If you are using multiple backend types, you can use a comma
                delimited list here. For example, if you are going to use both VSA and Ceph
                backends, you would specify something like this:
                  <codeph>enabled_backends=vsa-1,ceph1</codeph>.</note></li>
            <li>[OPTIONAL] If you want your volumes to use a default volume type, then enter the
              name of the volume type in the <codeph>[DEFAULT]</codeph> section with the syntax
              below. <b>You will want to remember this value when you create your volume type in the
                next section.</b>
              <p>
                <note type="important">If you do not specify a default type then your volumes will
                  default to a non-redundant RAID configuration. It is recommended that you create a
                  volume type and specify it here that meets your environments needs.</note>
              </p>
              <codeblock>[DEFAULT]
# Set the default volume type
default_volume_type = &lt;your new volume type></codeblock></li>
            <li>Uncomment the <codeph>StoreVirtual (VSA) cluster</codeph> section and fill the
              values as per your cluster information. If you have more than one cluster, you will
              need to add another similar section with its respective values. In the following
              example only one cluster is added. <codeblock>[vsa-1]
