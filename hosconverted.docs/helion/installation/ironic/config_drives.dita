            Ironic supports the use of configuration drives.  A user deploying nodes with Ironic directly must do so 
            by creating a whole configuration drive file.  In the case of Nova, individual files can be included 
            in the configuration drive upon instance creation. Sensitive information such as Passwords, Keys,
            or any other form of credential information SHOULD NOT be included in configuration drives.
        </p>
        <p>
            Configuration Drives should only be trusted upon the initial boot of an instance.  
            Cloud-init utilizes a lock file for this purpose.  Custom instance images SHOULD NOT rely upon the 
            integrity of a Configuration Drive beyond the initial boot of a host as an administrative user 
            with-in a deployed instance can potentially modify a configuration drive once written to disk and 
            released for use.</p>
