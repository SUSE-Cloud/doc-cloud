    Drives</title>
  <body><!--not tested-->
    <p conkeyref="HOS-conrefs/applies-to"/>
    <p>To install and deploy, Swift requires that the disk drives listed in the devices list of the
      device-groups item in a disk model meet the following criteria (if not, the deployment will
      fail):</p>
    <ul id="ul_fsy_255_dt">
      <li>The disk device must exist on the server. For example, if you add
          <codeph>/dev/sdx</codeph> to a server with only three devices, then the deploy process
        will fail.</li>
      <li>The disk device must be unpartitioned or have a single partition that uses the whole
        drive.</li>
      <li>The partition must not be labelled. For instructions, see <xref
          href="../../operations/troubleshooting/objectstorage/label_on_partition.dita#verify-partition-label"/>.</li>
      <li>The XFS file system must not contain a file system label. For instructions, see <xref
        href="../../operations/troubleshooting/objectstorage/filesystem_label.dita#verify-the-filesystem-label"/>.</li>
      <li>If the disk drive is already labeled as described above, the
          <codeph>swiftlm-drive-provision</codeph> process will assume that the drive has valuable
        data and will not use or modify the drive.</li>
    </ul>
