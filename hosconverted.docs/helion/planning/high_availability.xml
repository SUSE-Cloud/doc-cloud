      <title>High Availability Concepts Overview</title>
      <p>A highly available (HA) cloud ensures that a minimum level of cloud resources are always
        available on request, which results in uninterrupted operations for users.</p>
      <p>In order to achieve this high availability of infrastructure and workloads, we define the
        scope of HA to be limited to protecting these only against single points of failure (SPOF).
        Single points of failure include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Hardware SPOFs</b>: Hardware failures can take the form of server failures, memory
          going bad, power failures, hypervisors crashing, hard disks dying, NIC cards breaking,
          switch ports failing, network cables loosening, and so forth.</li>
        <li><b>Software SPOFs</b>: Server processes can crash due to software defects, out-of-memory
          conditions, operating system kernel panic, and so forth.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By design, <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> strives to create a system architecture resilient to
        SPOFs, and does not attempt to automatically protect the system against multiple cascading
        levels of failures; such cascading failures will result in an unpredictable state. Hence,
        the cloud operator is encouraged to recover and restore any failed component, as soon as the
        first level of failure occurs.</p>
      <sectiondiv id="cloud_infrastructure">
        <p><b>Highly Available Cloud Infrastructure</b></p>
        <p>Cloud users are able to provision and manage the compute, storage, and network
          infrastructure resources at any given point in time and the Horizon Dashboard and the
          OpenStack APIs must be reachable and be able to fulfill user requests.</p>
        <p><image href="../../media/ha30/ha-resilient-cloud-infrastructure.png"
            id="CloudInfrastructure"/></p>
        <p>Once the Compute, Storage, and Network resources are deployed, users expect these
          resources to be reliable in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If the nova-compute KVM hypervisors/servers hosting a project compute instance
            (virtual machine) dies and the compute instanceM is lost along with its local ephemeral
            storage, you will be able to re-launch a fresh compute instance successfully because it
            launches on another nova-compute KVM Hypervisor/server. The following mechanisms exist
            to ensure that data on compute instances are backed up: <ul>
              <li>The capability to create snapshot images of compute instances is available for
                your root partitions.</li>
              <li>If ephemeral storage loss is undesirable, the compute instance can be booted from
                a Cinder volume which can be re-used on new instances.</li>
            </ul></li>
          <li>Data stored in Block Storage service volumes can be made highly-available by
            clustering <xref href="#HP3.0HA/block_storage_vsa">(Details below in VSA section
              below)</xref></li>
          <li>Data stored by the Object service is always available <xref
              href="#HP3.0HA/object_storage_swift">(Details in Swift section below)</xref></li>
          <li>Network resources such as routers, subnets, and floating IP addresses provisioned by
            the Networking Operation service are made highly-available via Helion Control Plane
            redundancy and DVR.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> Compute hypervisors do not support transparent high
          availability for user applications; as such, the project application provider is

      <title>High Availability of Controllers</title>
      <p>The <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> installer deploys highly available configurations of
        OpenStack cloud services, resilient against single points of failure.</p>
      <p>The high availability of the controller components comes in two main forms.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Many services are stateless and multiple instances are run across the control plane in
          active-active mode. The API services (nova-api, cinder-api, etc.) are accessed through the
          HA proxy load balancer whereas the internal services (nova-scheduler, cinder-scheduler,
          etc.), are accessed through the message broker. These services use the database cluster to
          persist any data. <note>The HA proxy load balancer is also run in active-active mode and
            keepalived (used for Virtual IP (VIP) Management) is run in active-active mode, with
            only one keepalived instance holding the VIP at any one point in time.</note></li>
        <li>The high availability of the message queue service and the database service is achieved
          by running these in a clustered mode across the three nodes of the control plane: RabbitMQ
          cluster with Mirrored Queues and Percona MySQL Galera cluster.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><image href="../../media/ha30/HPE_HA_Flow.png" id="ControlPlane1"/></p>
      <p>The above diagram illustrates the HA architecture with the focus on VIP management and load
        balancing. It only shows a subset of active-active API instances and does not show examples
        of other services such as nova-scheduler, cinder-scheduler, etc.</p>
      <p>In the above diagram, requests from an OpenStack client to the API services are sent to VIP
        and port combination; for example, 192.0.2.26:8774 for a Nova request. The load balancer
        listens for requests on that VIP and port. When it receives a request, it selects one of the
        controller nodes configured for handling Nova requests, in this particular case, and then
        forwards the request to the IP of the selected controller node on the same port.</p>
      <p>The nova-api service, which is listening for requests on the IP of its host machine, then
        receives the request and deals with it accordingly. The database service is also accessed
        through the load balancer. RabbitMQ, on the other hand, is not currently accessed through
        VIP/HA proxy as the clients are configured with the set of nodes in the RabbitMQ cluster and
        failover between cluster nodes is automatically handled by the clients.</p>

        <p>With the above HA set up, loss of a controller node is handled as follows:</p>
        <p>Assume that the Controller0, which is currently in control of the VIP, is lost, as shown
          in the diagram below:</p>
        <p><image href="../../media/ha30/HPE_HA_NodeFailure1.png" id="ControlPlane3"/></p>
        <p>When this occurs, keepalived immediately moves the VIP on to Controller1 and can now
          receive API requests, which is load-balanced by HA proxy, as stated earlier.</p>
        <note>Although MySQL and RabbitMQ clusters have lost a node, they still continue to be
          operational:</note>
        <p><image href="../../media/ha30/HPE_HA_NodeFailure2.png" id="ControlPlane4"/></p>
        <p>Finally, when Controller0 comes back online, keepalived and HA proxy will resume in
          standby/slave mode and be ready to take over, should there be a failure of Controller1.
          The Controller0 rejoins the MySQL and RabbitMQ clusters.</p>
      </sectiondiv>
      <sectiondiv>
        <p id="network_partitions"><b>Handling Network Partitions</b></p>
        <p>It is important for the HA setup to tolerate network failures, specifically those that
          result in a partition of the cluster, whereby one of the three nodes in the control plane
          cannot communicate with the remaining two nodes of the cluster. The description of network
          partition handling is separated into the main HA components of the controller.</p>
      </sectiondiv>
      <sectiondiv>
        <p id="galera_cluster"><b>MySQL Galera Cluster</b></p>
        <p>The handling of network partitions is illustrated in the diagram below. Galera has a
          quorum mechanism so when there is a partition in the cluster, the primary or quorate
          partition can continue to operate as normal, whereas the non-primary/minority partition
          cannot commit any requests. In the example below, Controller0 is partitioned from the rest
          of the control plane. As a result, requests can only be satisfied on Controller1 or
          Controller2. Controller0 will continue to attempt to rejoin the cluster:</p>
        <p><image href="../../media/ha30/HPE_HA_MySQLGaleraCluster.png" id="ControlPlane5"/></p>
        <p>When HA proxy detects the errors against the mysql instance on Controller0, it removes
          that node from its pool for future database requests.</p>

          <p id="cinder_volume"><b>Cinder-Backup and Cinder-Volume</b></p>
          <p>Due to the single threading required in both cinder-volume and the drivers, the Cinder
            volume service is run as a singleton in the control plane. <image
              href="../../media/ha30/ha-cinder-volume.png" id="CinderVolume"/></p>
          <p>Cinder-volume is deployed on all three controller nodes, but kept active on only one
            node at a time. By default, cinder-volume is kept active on the controller. If the
            controller fails, you must enable and start the cinder-volume service on one of the
            other controller nodes, until it is restored. Once the controller is restored, you must
            shut down the Cinder volume service from all other nodes and start it on the controller
            to ensure it runs as a singleton.</p>
          <p>Since cinder.conf is kept synchronized across all the 3 nodes, Cinder volume can be run
            on any of the nodes at any given time. Ensure that it is run on only one node at a
            time.</p>
          <p>Details of how to activate Cinder Volume after controller failure is documented in<xref
              href="../operations/blockstorage/managing_cinder_volumebackup_services.dita#topic_l1p_vpy_jt"

        <sectiondiv>
          <p id="nova_consoleauth"><b>Nova consoleauth</b></p>
          <p>If the controller fails, the Nova consoleauth service will become unavailable and users
            will not be able to connect to their VM consoles via VNC. The service will be restored
            once you restore the controller.</p>

        <p id="failed_controller_nodes"><b>Rebuilding or Replacing failed Controller Nodes</b></p>
        <p>As described above, the three node controller cluster provides a robust, highly available
          control plane of OpenStack services. Controllers not running any of the singleton services
          can be shut down for a short duration for maintenance activities without impacting cloud
          service availability. The Controller running any of the singleton services cannot be shut
          down without affecting cloud service availability.</p>
        <note>The HA design is only robust against single points of failure and may not protect you
          against multiple levels of failure. As soon as first-level failure occurs, you must try to
          fix the symptom/root cause and recover from the failure, as soon as possible.</note>
        <p>In the unlikely event that one of the controller servers suffers an irreparable hardware
          failure, you can decommission and delete it from the cluster. You can then deploy the
          failed controller on a new server and connect it back into the original three node
          controller cluster. Learn more about <xref

        element is the Layer 3 agent a.k.a L3 agent. By making L3 agent highly available, upon
        failure all HA routers are migrated from the primary L3 agent to a secondary L3 agent. The
        implementation efficiency of an HA subsystem is measured by the number of packets that are
        lost when the secondary L3 agent is made the master. </p>
      <p>In <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/>, the primary and secondary L3 agents run continuously, and
        failover involves a rapid switchover of mastership to the secondary agent (IEFT RFC 5798).
        The failover essentially involves a switchover from a already running master to already
        running slave. This substantially reduces the latency of the HA. The mechanism used by the
        master and the slave to implement a failover is implemented using Linux’s pacemaker HA
        resource manager. This CRM (Cluster resource manager) uses VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy
        Protocol) to implement the HA mechanism. VRRP is a industry standard protocol and defined in
        RFC 5798.</p>
      <p><image href="../../media/ha30/HPE_HA_Layer-3HA.png" id="Layer3HA"/></p>
      <p>L3 HA uses of VRRP comes with several benefits.</p>
      <p>The primary benefit is the failover mechanism does not involve interprocess communication
        overhead (order of 10s of seconds). By not using an RPC mechanism to invoke the secondary
        agent to assume the primary agents role enables VRRP to achieve failover within 1-2 seconds. </p>
      <p>In VRRP, the primary and secondary routers are all active. As the routers are running, it
        is a matter of making the router aware of its primary/master status. This switchover takes
        less than 2 seconds instead of 60+ seconds it would have taken to start a backup router and
        failover. </p>
      <p>The failover depends upon a heartbeat link between the primary and secondary. That link in
          <keyword keyref="kw-hos-phrase-30"/> uses keepalived package of the pacemaker resource
        manager. The heartbeats are sent at a 2 second intervals between the primary and secondary.
        As per the VRRP protocol, if the secondary does not hear from the master after 3 intervals,
        it assumes the function of the primary. </p>
      <p>Further, all the routable IP addresses i.e. the VIPs (virtual IPs) are assigned to the
        primary agent. </p>

      <title>High Availability Routing - Distributed</title>
      <p>The OpenStack Distributed Virtual Router (DVR) function delivers HA through its distributed
        architecture. The one centralized function remaining is source network address translation
        (SNAT), where high availability is provided by DVR SNAT HA. </p>
      <p>DVR SNAT HA is enabled on a per router basis and requires that two or more L3 agents
        capable of providing SNAT services be running on the system. If a minimum number of L3
        agents is configured to 1 or lower, the neutron server will fail to start and a log message
        will be created. The L3 Agents must be running on a control-plane node, L3 agents running on
        a compute node do not provide SNAT services. </p>

      <p>While planning your OpenStack deployment, you should decide on how to zone various types of
        nodes - such as compute, block storage, and object storage. For example, you may decide to
        place all servers in the same rack in the same zone. For larger deployments, you may plan
        more elaborate redundancy schemes for redundant power, network ISP connection, and even
        physical firewalling between zones (<i>this aspect is outside the scope of this
        document</i>).</p>
      <p><keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> offers APIs, CLIs and Horizon UIs for the administrator to

        section outlines the process to deploy specific types of nodes to specific physical servers,
        and makes a statement of available support for these types of availability zones in the

    <section id="object_storage_swift">
      <title>Object Storage with Swift</title>
      <p>High availability in Swift is achieved at two levels.</p>
      <p><b>Control Plane</b></p>
      <p>The Swift API is served by multiple Swift proxy nodes. Client requests are directed to all
        Swift proxy nodes by the HA Proxy load balancer in round-robin fashion. The HA Proxy load
        balancer regularly checks the node is responding, so that if it fails, traffic is directed
        to the remaining nodes. The Swift service will continue to operate and respond to client
        requests as long as at least one Swift proxy server is running.</p>
      <p>If a Swift proxy node fails in the middle of a transaction, the transaction fails. However
        it is standard practice for Swift clients to retry operations. This is transparent to
        applications that use the python-swiftclient library.</p>
      <p>The entry-scale example cloud models contain three Swift proxy nodes. However, it is
        possible to add additional clusters with additional Swift proxy nodes to handle a larger
        workload or to provide additional resiliency.</p>
      <p><b>Data</b></p>
      <p>Multiple replicas of all data is stored. This happens for account, container and object
        data. The example cloud models recommend a replica count of three. However, you may change
        this to a higher value if needed.</p>
      <p>When Swift stores different replicas of the same item on disk, it ensures that as far as
        possible, each replica is stored in a different zone, server or drive. This means that if a
        single server of disk drives fails, there should be two copies of the item on other servers
        or disk drives.</p>
      <p>If a disk drive is failed, Swift will continue to store three replicas. The replicas that
        would normally be stored on the failed drive are “handed off” to another drive on the
        system. When the failed drive is replaced, the data on that drive is reconstructed by the
        replication process. The replication process re-creates the “missing” replicas by copying
        them to the drive using one of the other remaining replicas. While this is happening, Swift
        can continue to store and retrieve data.</p>

      <title>Highly Available Cloud Applications and Workloads</title>
      <p>Projects writing applications to be deployed in the cloud must be aware of the cloud
        architecture and potential points of failure and architect their applications accordingly
        for high availability.</p>
      <p>Some guidelines for consideration:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Assume intermittent failures and plan for retries <ul>
            <li><b>OpenStack Service APIs</b>: invocations can fail - you should carefully evaluate
              the response of each invocation, and retry in case of failures.</li>
            <li><b>Compute</b>: VMs can die - monitor and restart them</li>
            <li><b>Network</b>: Network calls can fail - retry should be successful</li>
            <li><b>Storage</b>: Storage connection can hiccup - retry should be successful</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Build redundancy into your application tiers <ul>
            <li>
              <ul>
                <li>Replicate VMs containing stateless services such as Web application tier or Web
                  service API tier and put them behind load balancers (you must implement your own
                  HA Proxy type load balancer in your application VMs until <keyword keyref="kw-hos"
                  /> delivers the LBaaS service). </li>
                <li>Boot the replicated VMs into different Nova availability zones.</li>
                <li>If your VM stores state information on its local disk (Ephemeral Storage), and
                  you cannot afford to lose it, then boot the VM off a Cinder volume.</li>
                <li>Take periodic snapshots of the VM which will back it up to Swift through
                  Glance.</li>
                <li>Your data on ephemeral may get corrupted (but not your backup data in Swift and
                  not your data on Cinder volumes).</li>
                <li>Take regular snapshots of Cinder volumes and also back up Cinder volumes or your
                  data exports into Swift.</li>

            </li>
          </ul>
