      <phrase/>Example Configurations</title>
    <para/>
    
    <para>The <phrase/> system ships with a collection of pre-qualified example
      configurations. These are designed to help you to get up and running quickly with a minimum
      number of configuration changes.</para>
    
    <para>The <phrase/> input model allows a wide variety of configuration parameters
      that may, at first glance, appear daunting. The example configurations are designed to
      simplify this process by providing pre-built and pre-qualified examples that need only a
      minimum number of modifications to get started.</para>

         <phrase/> Example Configurations</bridgehead>
      <para>This section briefly describes the various example configurations and their capabilities.
        It also describes in detail, for the entry-scale-kvm-vsa example, how you can adapt the
        input model to work in your environment.</para>
      <para>The following pre-qualified examples are shipped with <phrase/>:</para>

      <para>The entry-scale systems are designed to provide an entry-level solution that can be scaled
        from a small number of nodes to a moderately high node count (approximately 100 compute
        nodes, for example).</para>
      <para>In the mid-scale model, the cloud control plane is subdivided into a number of dedicated
        service clusters to provide more processing power for individual control plane elements.
        This enables a greater number of resources to be supported (compute nodes, Swift object
        servers). This model also shows how a segmented network can be expressed in the <phrase/> model.</para>
