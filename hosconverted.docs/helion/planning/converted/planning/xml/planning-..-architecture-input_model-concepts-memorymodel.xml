    <para/>

    <para>Memory models define how the memory of a server should be configured to meet the needs of a 
      particular role. It allows a number of HugePages to be defined at both the server 
      and numa-node level.</para>
    
    <para userlevel="INTERNAL">Memory models also provide memory sizing information for virtual machine servers.</para>
    
    <para>Memory models are optional - it is valid to have a server role without a memory model.</para>
