    Drives</title>
    <para/>
    <para>To install and deploy, Swift requires that the disk drives listed in the devices list of the
      device-groups item in a disk model meet the following criteria (if not, the deployment will
      fail):</para>
    <itemizedlist id="ul_fsy_255_dt">
      <listitem>
         <para>The disk device must exist on the server. For example, if you add
          <literal>/dev/sdx</literal> to a server with only three devices, then the deploy process
        will fail.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para>The disk device must be unpartitioned or have a single partition that uses the whole
        drive.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para>The partition must not be labelled. For instructions, see <xref linkend="verify-partition-label"/>.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para>The XFS file system must not contain a file system label. For instructions, see <xref linkend="verify-the-filesystem-label"/>.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para>If the disk drive is already labeled as described above, the
          <literal>swiftlm-drive-provision</literal> process will assume that the drive has valuable
        data and will not use or modify the drive.</para>
