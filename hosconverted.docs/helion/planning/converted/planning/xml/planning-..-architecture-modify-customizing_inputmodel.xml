            <para>This section covers additional changes that you can make to further adapt the example to
                your environment:</para>
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
         <para>Update <literal>disks_controller.yml</literal> to add additional disk capacity to your
                    controllers.</para>
      </listitem>
                <listitem>
         <para>Update <literal>disks_vsa.yml</literal> to add additional disk capacity to your VSA
                    servers.</para>
      </listitem>
                <listitem>
         <para>Update <literal>disks_compute.yml</literal> to add additional disk capacity to your
                    compute servers.</para>
      </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>

        
      <bridgehead renderas="sect4">disks_controller.yml</bridgehead>
      <para>The disk configuration of the controllers consists of two sections: a definition of a
                volume group that provides a number of file-systems for various subsystems, and device-group
                that provides disk capacity for Swift.</para>
   
        
        
      <bridgehead renderas="sect4">File Systems Storage</bridgehead>
      <para>The root volume group (hlm-vg) is divided into a number of logical volumes that provide
                separate file systems for the various services that are co-hosted on the controllers in the
                entry-scale examples. The capacity of each file system is expressed as a percentage of the
                overall volume group capacity. Because not all file system usage scales linearly, two
                different disk configurations are provided:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
            <para>
               <emphasis role="bold">CONTROLLER-DISKS</emphasis> - Based on a 512 GB root volume group.</para>
         </listitem>
                <listitem>
            <para>
               <emphasis role="bold">CONTROLLER-1TB-DISKS</emphasis> - Provides a higher percentage of space for the logging
                    service.</para>
         </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
      <para>As supplied, the example uses the smaller disk model. To use the larger disk model you need
                to modify the <literal>disk-models</literal> parameter in the
                <literal>server_roles.yml</literal> file, as shown below:</para>
      <screen>
    server-roles:
        
       - name: CONTROLLER-ROLE
         interface-model: CONTROLLER-INTERFACES
         disk-model: CONTROLLER-1TB-DISKS</screen>
      <para>To add additional disks to the root volume group, you need to modify the volume group
                definition in whichever disk model you are using. The following example shows adding an
                additional disk, <literal>/dev/sdd</literal> to the <literal>disks_controller.yml</literal>
                file:</para>
      <screen>
   disk-models:
      - name: CONTROLLER-DISKS
        
        volume-groups:
         - name: hlm-vg
           physical-volumes:
        
              # NOTE: 'sda_root' is a templated value. This value is checked in
              # os-config and replaced by the partition actually used on sda
              #e.g. sda1 or sda5
              - /dev/sda_root
              <emphasis role="bold">- /dev/sdd</emphasis>
      </screen>
   
        
        
      <bridgehead renderas="sect4">Swift Storage</bridgehead>
      <para>Swift storage is configured as a device-group and has a syntax that allows disks to be
                allocated to specific rings. In the example, two disks are allocated to Swift to be shared
                by the account, container, and object-0 rings.</para>
      <screen>
   device-groups:
       - name: swiftobj
         devices:
            - name: /dev/sdb
            - name: /dev/sdc
            # Add any additional disks for swift here
            # -name: /dev/sdd
            # -name: /dev/sde
         consumer:
           name: swift
           attrs:
              rings:
                 - account
                 - container
                       - object-0</screen>
      <para>For instruction to configure additional Swift storage, see <xref linkend="allocating-disk-drives"/>.</para>
   
        
        
      <bridgehead renderas="sect4">disks_vsa.yml</bridgehead>
      <para>VSA storage is configured as a device-group and has a syntax that allows disks to be
                allocated for data storage or for adaptive optimization (caching). As a best practice, you
                should use solid state drives for adaptive optimization. The example disk configuration for
                VSA nodes has two disks, one for data and one of adaptive optimization. (For more
                information, see .)</para>
      <screen>
   device-groups:
       - name: vsa-data
         consumer:
           name: vsa
           usage: data
         devices:
           - name: /dev/sdc
       - name: vsa-cache
         consumer:
           name: vsa
           usage: adaptive-optimization
         devices:
            - name: /dev/sdb</screen>
      <para>Additional capacity can be added by adding more disks to the <literal>vsa-data</literal>
                device group. Similarly, caching capacity can be increased by adding more high speed storage
                devices to the <literal>vsa-cache</literal> device group.</para>
   
        
        
      <bridgehead renderas="sect4">disks_compute.yml</bridgehead>
      <para>The example disk configuration for compute nodes consists of two volume groups: one for the
                operating system and one for the ephemeral storage for virtual machines, with one disk
                allocated to each.</para>
      <para>Additional virtual machine ephemeral storage capacity can be configured by adding
                additional disks to the <literal>vg-comp</literal> volume group. The following example shows
                the addition of two more disks, <literal>/dev/sdc</literal> and <literal>/dev/sdd</literal>, to
                the <literal>disks_compute.yml</literal> file:</para>
      <screen>

        physical-volumes:
          - /dev/sdb
          - /dev/sdc
          - /dev/sdd
        logical-volumes:
          - name: compute
            size: 95%
            mount: /var/lib/nova
            fstype: ext4
