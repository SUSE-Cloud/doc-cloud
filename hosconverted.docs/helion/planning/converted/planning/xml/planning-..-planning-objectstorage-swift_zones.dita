      <para>The concept of Swift zones allows you to control the placement of replicas on different
        groups of servers. When constructing rings and allocating replicas to specific disk drives,
        Swift will, where possible, allocate replicas using the following hierarchy so that the
        greatest amount of resiliency is achieved by avoiding single points of failure:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>Swift will place each replica on a different disk drive within the same server.</para>
         </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Swift will place each replica on a different server.</para>
         </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Swift will place each replica in a different Swift zone.</para>
         </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>If you have three servers and a replica count of three, it is easy for Swift to place each
        replica on a different server. If you only have two servers though, Swift will place two
        replicas on one server (different drives on the server) and one copy on the other
        server.</para>
      <para>With only three servers there is no need to use the Swift zone concept. However, if you
        have more servers than your replica count, the Swift zone concept can be used to control the
        degree of resiliency. The following table shows how data is placed and explains what happens
        under various failure scenarios. In all cases, a replica count of three is assumed and that
        there are a total of six servers.</para>
