    <para>A region in OpenStack terms is a collection of URLs that together provide a consistent set of services
        (Nova, Neutron, Swift, etc). Regions are represented in the Keystone identity service
        catalog and clients can decide which region they want to use.</para>
   <para>For the owner of a cloud, regions provide a way of segmenting resources for scale,
        resilience, and isolation.<!-- However, each region needs some resources for its
        <uicontrol>control-plane</uicontrol>.--></para>
   <para>In a simple single control-plane cloud,  there is no need for a separate region definition 
            and the control-plane itself can define the region name.</para>
