    <para>
      <emphasis>A <guilabel>server-role</guilabel> identifies an
        <guilabel>interface-model</guilabel> that describes how its network interfaces are to
        be configured and used.</emphasis>
   </para>
        
    <para>Network groups are mapped onto specific network interfaces via an
        <guilabel>interface-model</guilabel>, which describes the network devices that need to
        be created (bonds, ovs-bridges, etc) and their properties.</para>
        
    <para>An <guilabel>interface-model</guilabel> acts like a template; it can define how some or
        all of the <guilabel>network-groups</guilabel> are to be mapped for a particular
        combination of physical NICs. However, it is the <guilabel>service-components</guilabel>
        on each server that determine which <guilabel>network-groups</guilabel> are required and
        hence which interfaces and <guilabel>networks</guilabel> will be configured. This means
        that <guilabel>interface-models</guilabel> can be shared between different
        <guilabel>server-roles</guilabel>. For example, an API role and a database role may
        share an interface model even though they may have different disk models and they will
        require a different subset of the <guilabel>network-groups</guilabel>.</para>
    <para>Within an <guilabel>interface-model</guilabel>, physical ports are identified by a device
        name, which in turn is resolved to a physical port on a server basis  via a <guilabel>nic-mapping</guilabel>.
        To allow different physical servers to share an <guilabel>interface-model</guilabel>, the
        <guilabel>nic-mapping</guilabel> is defined as a property of each
        <guilabel>server</guilabel>.</para>
        
        <para>The <literal>interface-model</literal> can also used to describe how network devices are to be configured for use with DPDK, SR-IOV, and PCI Passthrough.</para>
