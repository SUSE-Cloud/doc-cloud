    <para/>

    <para>The dependencies between service components (e.g. Nova needs MySql and Keystone API) is
        defined as part of the service definitions provide by <phrase/>, the control-planes define how
        those dependencies will be met. For clouds consisting of multiple control-planes, the
        relationship between services in different control planes is defined by a <literal>uses</literal> attribute
        in its control-plane object. Services will always use other services in the same
        control-plane before looking to see if the required service can be provided from another
        control- plane. For example, a service component in control-plane <literal>cp-2</literal> (e.g. nova-api)
        might use service components from control-plane <literal>cp-shared</literal> (e.g. keystone-api). </para>
