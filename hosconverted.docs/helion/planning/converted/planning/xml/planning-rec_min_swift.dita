      <phrase/>Recommended Hardware Minimums for an Entry-scale
    Swift Model</title>
    <para>These recommended minimums are based on the included  included with the base installation and are suitable only for
      demo environments. For production systems you will want to consider your capacity and
      performance requirements when making decisions about your hardware.</para>
   <para>The <literal>entry-scale-swift</literal> example runs the Swift proxy, account and container
      services on the three controller servers. However, it is possible to extend the model to
      include the Swift proxy, account and container services on dedicated servers (typically
      referred to as the Swift proxy servers). If you are using this model, we have included the
      recommended Swift proxy servers specs in the table below.</para>

      <emphasis role="bold">Considerations for your Swift object and proxy, account, container servers RAM and disk
        capacity needs</emphasis>
   </para>
   <para>Swift can have a diverse number of hardware configurations. For example, a Swift object
      server may have just a few disks (minimum of 6 for erasure codes) or up to 70 and beyond. The
      memory requirement needs to be increased as more disks are added. The general rule of thumb
      for memory needed is 0.5 GB per TB of storage. For example, a system with 24 hard drives at
      8TB each, giving a total capacity of 192TB, should use 96GB of RAM. However, this does not
      work well for a system with a small number of small hard drives or a very large number of very
      large drives. So, if after calculating the memory given this guideline, if the answer is less
      than 32GB then go with 32GB of memory minimum and if the answer is over 256GB then use 256GB
      maximum, no need to use more memory than that.</para>
   <para>When considering the capacity needs for the Swift proxy, account, and container (PAC)
      servers, you should calculate 2% of the total raw storage size of your object servers to
      specify the storage required for the PAC servers. So, for example, if you were using the
      example we provided earlier and you had an object server setup of 24 hard drives with 8TB each
      for a total of 192TB and you had a total of 6 object servers, that would give a raw total of
      1152TB. So you would take 2% of that, which is 23TB, and ensure that much storage capacity was
      available on your Swift proxy, account, and container (PAC) server cluster. If you had a
      cluster of three Swift PAC servers, that would be ~8TB each.</para>
   <para>Another general rule of thumb is that if you are expecting to have more than a million
      objects in a container then you should consider using SSDs on the Swift PAC servers rather
      than HDDs.</para>
