    <para>In addition to the mapping of <guilabel>services</guilabel> to specific
        <guilabel>clusters</guilabel> and <guilabel>resources</guilabel> we must also be able
        to define how the <guilabel>services</guilabel> connect to one or more
        <guilabel>networks</guilabel>.</para>
    <para>In a simple cloud there may be a single L3 network but more typically there are functional
        and physical layers of network separation that need to be expressed.</para>
    <para>Functional network separation provides different networks for different types of traffic;
        for example, it is common practice in even small clouds to separate the External APIs that
        users will use to access the cloud and the external IP addresses that users will use to
        access their virtual machines. In more complex clouds it's common to also separate out
        virtual networking between virtual machines, block storage traffic, and volume traffic onto
        their own sets of networks. In the input model, this level of separation is represented by
        <guilabel>network-groups</guilabel>.</para>
    <para>Physical separation is required when there are separate L3 network segments providing the
        same type of traffic; for example, where each rack uses a different subnet. This level of
        separation is represented in the input model by the <guilabel>networks</guilabel> within
        each <guilabel>network-group</guilabel>.</para>
