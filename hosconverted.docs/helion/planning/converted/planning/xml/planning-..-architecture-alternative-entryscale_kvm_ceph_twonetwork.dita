      <phrase/>Entry-scale KVM with Ceph Model with Two
        Networks</title>
        
        

        <para><phrase/> Ceph is a unified storage system for various storage use cases
            for an OpenStack-based cloud. It is highly reliable, easy to manage, and horizontally
            scalable as demand grows.</para>

        <para>Ceph clients directly talk to OSD daemons for storage operations instead of client
            routing the request to a specific gateway as is commonly found in other storage
            solutions. OSD daemons perform data replication and participate in recovery activities.
            In general, a pool is configured with a replica count of three, causing daemons to
            transact three times the amount of client data over the cluster network. So, every 4 MB
            of write data is likely to result in 12 MB of data movement across Ceph clusters.
            Considering this network traffic, it is important to segregate Ceph data traffic, which
            can be primarily categorized into three segments:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
         <para><emphasis role="bold">Management traffic</emphasis> - primarily includes all admin related operations such as
                pool creation, crush map modification, user creation, etc.</para>

      </listitem>
            <listitem>
         <para><emphasis role="bold">Client (data) traffic</emphasis> - primarily includes client requests sent to OSD
                daemons.</para>

      </listitem>
            <listitem>
         <para><emphasis role="bold">Cluster (replication) traffic</emphasis> - primarily includes replication and recovery
                data traffic among OSD daemons.</para>

      </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>For a high performing cluster, the network configuration is important. Segregating the
            data traffic using multiple networks allows for this. For medium-size production
            environments we recommend to have a cluster with at least two networks: a client data
            network (front-side) and a cluster (back-side) network. For larger production
            environments we recommend that you segregate all three network traffic types by
            utilizing three networks. This particular document shows you how to setup two networks
            but you can use the same principles to create three networks.</para>

        <para>Also, segregating networks provides additional security as well because your cluster
            network does not need to be connected to the internet directly. This helps in preventing
            spoof attacks and allows the OSD daemons to keep communicating without intervention so
            that placement groups can be brought to active + clean state whenever required.</para>

        <para>This model is a variant of the Entry-scale KVM with Ceph model. It is designed with two
            VLANs: a public (front-side) network and a cluster (back-side) network. This enables
            more options in regards to scaling.</para>

        <para>This model uses the following components:</para>
<itemizedlist id="ul_ckz_3tl_s5">
                <listitem>
            <para>Three controller nodes, one KVM compute node, and three Ceph OSD nodes.</para>
         </listitem>
                <listitem>
            <para>The Ceph monitor component of the Ceph cluster is deployed on the controller
                    nodes along with other OpenStack service components. This limits your cloud to
                    three monitor nodes which should be suitable for most production
                    environments.</para>
         </listitem>
                <listitem>
            <para>Allows two VLANs (i.e. management VLAN and OSD VLAN) which segregates Ceph
                    client traffic from Ceph cluster traffic. The management network will be used to
                    carry cloud management data, such as RabbitMQ, HOPS, and database traffic, Ceph
                    management data, such as pool creation, as well as client data traffic, such as
                    cinder-volume writing blocks to Ceph storage pools. The Ceph cluster network
                    will be dedicated for OSD daemons and will be used to carry replication
                    traffic.</para>
         </listitem>
                <listitem>
            <para>A single compute node is initially provided with this example configuration. If
                    additional compute capacity is required then further compute nodes can be added
                    to the configuration by adding more nodes to the compute resource plane. The
                    same applies to OSD nodes as well. Three OSD nodes are initially provided with
                    this example configuration. If additional OSD capacity is required then further
                    OSD nodes can be added to the configuration by adding more nodes to the OSD
                    resource plane.</para>

        <para>This configuration is based on the entry-scale-kvm-ceph cloud input model which is
            included with the <phrase/> distro. You will need to make the changes
            outlined below prior to the deployment of your Ceph cluster with two networks. Note that
            if you already have a Ceph cluster deployed with a single network these steps cannot be
            used to migrate to a dual-network setup. The recommendation in these cases will be that
            you make a clean installation which will result in the loss of your existing data unless
            you make arrangements to have it backed up beforehand.</para>
