      <phrase/>Deploying Ceph Monitor Services on Dedicated
        Resource Nodes</title>
        
        
        <para>In the <phrase/> example configurations, the Ceph monitor service
            is installed on the controller nodes by default. If you wish to break these out into
            their own cluster then you can do so by modifying the input model to form a separate
                cluster.</para>
<important>
         <para>If you want to deploy the monitor service as a
                dedicated resource node, then you must decide prior to the deployment of Ceph.
                    <phrase/> does not support deployment transition. Once
                Ceph is deployed, you cannot migrate the monitor service from controller to
                dedicated resource nodes. </para>
      </important>

        
      <bridgehead renderas="sect4">Prerequisite</bridgehead>
      <para>The lifecycle manager must be set up before starting Ceph deployment. For more
                details on the installation of the lifecycle manager, see <citetitle>FIXME: broken external xref</citetitle>.</para>

   
        
      <bridgehead renderas="sect4">To Install the Ceph Monitor Service on Dedicated Resource
                Nodes</bridgehead>
      <para>Perform the following procedure to install the Ceph monitor on dedicated nodes. Note
                that Ceph requires at least 3 monitoring servers to form a cluster in case of node
                failure.</para>
