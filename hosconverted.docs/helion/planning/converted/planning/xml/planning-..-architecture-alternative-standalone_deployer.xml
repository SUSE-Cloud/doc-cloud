      <phrase/>Using a Dedicated Lifecycle Manager
        Node</title>
        
        

        <para>All of the example configurations included host the lifecycle manager on the first
                controller nodes. It is also possible to deploy this service on a dedicated node. A
                typical use case for wanting to run the dedicated lifecycle manager is to be able to
                test the deployment of different configurations without having to re-install the
                first server. Some administrators might also prefer the additional security of
                keeping all of the configuration data on a separate server from those that users of
                the cloud connect to (although all of the data can be encrypted and SSH keys can be
                password protected).</para>

   <para>Here is a graphical representation of what this setup would look like:</para>

      <para>The snippet below shows the addition of a single node cluster into the control plane
                to host the lifecycle manager service. Note that, in addition to adding the new
                cluster, you also have to remove the lifecycle manager component from the
