      <title>The need for auditing</title>Enterprises need the ability to audit and monitor
      workflows and data in accordance with their strict corporate, industry or governmental
      policies and compliance requirements such as FIPS-140-2, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, SOX, or ISO . To meet
      this need, <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> supports CADF (Cloud Auditing Data Federation)-compliant
      security audit logs that can easily be integrated with your organization's Security
      Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools. Such auditing is valuable not only to meet
      regulatory compliance requirements, but also for correlating threat forensics.</section>
    <section>
      <p>Note that logs from existing OpenStack services can also be used for auditing purposes,
        even though they are not in a consistent audit friendly CADF format today. All logs can
        easily be integrated with a SIEM tool such as <xref href="arcsight.dita#arcsight">HPE
          ArcSight</xref>, Splunk etc. </p>
    </section>  <section>
      <title>Audit middleware </title>Audit middleware is python middleware logic that addresses the
      aforementioned logging shortcomings. Audit middleware constructs audit event data in easily
      consumed CADF format. This data can be mined to answer critical questions about activities
      over REST resources such as who made the request, when, why, and so forth.<p>Audit middleware
        supports delivery of audit data via the Oslo messaging notifier feature. Each service is
        configured to route data to an audit-specific log file. </p> The following are key aspects
      of auditing support in <keyword keyref="kw-hos-phrase"/>: <ul>
        <li>Auditing is disabled by default and can be enabled only after <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/>
          installation. </li>
        <li>Auditing support has been added to eight <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> services (Nova,
          Cinder, Glance, Keystone, Neutron, Heat, Barbican, and Ceilometer). </li>
        <li>Auditing has been added for interactions where REST API calls are invoked. </li>
        <li>All audit events are recorded in a service-specific audit log file. </li>
        <li>Auditing configuration is centrally managed and indicates for which services auditing is
          currently disabled or enabled. </li>
        <li>Auditing can be enabled or disabled on a per-service basis. </li>
        <!--<li>Support for centralized delivery of audit events to logstash for potential
          transformation, then to elastic search and the ability to analyze audit events is going to
          be added in future release(s). </li>-->

      <title>Centralized auditing configuration</title>
      In <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/>, all auditing
      configuration is centrally managed and controlled via input model YAML  files on the lifecycle
      manager node. The settings are configured in the file
        <codeph>~/helion/my_cloud/definition/cloudConfig.yml</codeph> in a newly added
   audit-settings section shown below the following table. <table frame="all" rowsep="1" colsep="1" id="table_vpc_m2t_lv">
