This script helps hpcloud writers to correctly push their new and changed markdown files to the documentation repository on git.hpcloud.net.  The script checks to ensure that the user is connected to the hpcloud.net VPN, is running the script in the documentation repository and from the documentation branch. 
			
The script process the FILES that the user indicates.  Wildcards may be used. If no files are provided by the user, the script processes all changed MD files in the current directory.

The user is asked to provide a commit message, and must indicate if the files are draft files, or if they are ready to be published on docs.hpcloud.com. The user is then presented with a summary of the changes to be made.  If the user indicates that the change summary is correct, the script modifies (or adds) the appropriate publication comment, then add, commits and pushes the files to git.hpcoud.net.

To install this script (so that you can run it anywhere in the documenation repo) , run the following command in your git bash shell:  cp ~/git/documentation/teamscripts/hpcommit /bin/
