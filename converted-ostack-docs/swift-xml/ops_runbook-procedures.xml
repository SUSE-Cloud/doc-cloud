Caution: The CRC for the backup partition table is invalid. This table may
be corrupt. This program will automatically create a new backup partition
table when you save your partitions.

Caution: Partition 1 doesn't begin on a 8-sector boundary. This may
result in degraded performance on some modern (2009 and later) hard disks.

Caution: Partition 2 doesn't begin on a 8-sector boundary. This may
result in degraded performance on some modern (2009 and later) hard disks.

Caution: Partition 3 doesn't begin on a 8-sector boundary. This may
result in degraded performance on some modern (2009 and later) hard disks.

    <title>Procedure: Revive a deleted account</title>
    <para>Swift accounts are normally not recreated. If a tenant/project is deleted,
                the account can then be deleted. If the user wishes to use Swift again,
                the normal process is to create a new tenant/project – and hence a
                new Swift account.</para>
    <para>However, if the Swift account is deleted, but the tenant/project is not
                deleted from Keystone, the user can no longer access the account. This
                is because the account is marked deleted in Swift. You can revive
                the account as described in this process.</para>
    <note>
      <para>The containers and objects in the “old” account cannot be listed
                    anymore. In addition, if the Account Reaper process has not
                    finished reaping the containers and objects in the “old” account, these
                    are effectively orphaned and it is virtually impossible to find and delete
                    them to free up disk space.</para>
    </note>
    <para>The solution is to delete the account database files and
                re-create the account as follows:</para>
    <procedure>
      <step>
        <para>You must know the tenant/project ID. The account name is AUTH_&lt;project-id&gt;.
                        In this example, the tenant/project is <literal>4ebe3039674d4864a11fe0864ae4d905</literal>
                        so the Swift account name is <literal>AUTH_4ebe3039674d4864a11fe0864ae4d905</literal>.</para>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>Use <literal>swift-get-nodes</literal> to locate the account’s database files (on three
                        servers). The output has been truncated so we can focus on the import pieces
                        of data:</para>

      </step>
      <step>
        <para>Before proceeding check that the account is really deleted by using curl. Execute the

    <title>Procedure: Temporarily stop load balancers from directing traffic to a proxy server</title>
    <para>You can stop the load balancers sending requests to a proxy server as
                follows. This can be useful when a proxy is misbehaving but you need
                Swift running to help diagnose the problem. By removing from the load
                balancers, customer’s are not impacted by the misbehaving proxy.</para>
    <procedure>
      <step>
        <para>Ensure that in /etc/swift/proxy-server.conf the <literal>disable_path</literal> variable is set to

    <para>It works because the healthcheck middleware looks for /etc/swift/disabled-by-file.
                If it exists, the middleware will return 503/error instead of 200/OK. This means the load balancer
                should stop sending traffic to the proxy.</para>

    <para>You can expect ~600MB/sec. If you get a low number, repeat many times as
                Swift itself may also read or write to the disk, hence giving a lower
                number.</para>
