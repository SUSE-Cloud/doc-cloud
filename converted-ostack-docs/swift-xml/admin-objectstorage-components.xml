  <title>Components</title>
  <para>Object Storage uses the following components to deliver high
            availability, high durability, and high concurrency:</para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Proxy servers</emphasis> - Handle all of the incoming API requests.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>

    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Zones</emphasis> - Isolate data from other zones. A failure in one zone
                    does not impact the rest of the cluster as data replicates
                    across zones.</para>

    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Accounts and containers</emphasis> - Each account and container are
                    individual databases that are distributed across the cluster. An
                    account database contains the list of containers in that account. A

    <title>Proxy servers</title>
    <para>Proxy servers are the public face of Object Storage and handle all of
                the incoming API requests. Once a proxy server receives a request, it
                determines the storage node based on the object’s URL, for example:
                <literal>https://swift.example.com/v1/account/container/object</literal>. Proxy servers
                also coordinate responses, handle failures, and coordinate timestamps.</para>
    <para>Proxy servers use a shared-nothing architecture and can be scaled as
                needed based on projected workloads. A minimum of two proxy servers
                should be deployed behind a separately-managed load balancer. If one
                proxy server fails, the others take over.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Rings</title>
    <para>A ring represents a mapping between the names of entities stored in the
                cluster and their physical locations on disks. There are separate rings
                for accounts, containers, and objects. When components of the system need
                to perform an operation on an object, container, or account, they need to
                interact with the corresponding ring to determine the appropriate location
                in the cluster.</para>
    <para>The ring maintains this mapping using zones, devices, partitions, and
                replicas. Each partition in the ring is replicated, by default, three
                times across the cluster, and partition locations are stored in the
                mapping maintained by the ring. The ring is also responsible for
                determining which devices are used as handoffs in failure scenarios.</para>
    <para>Data can be isolated into zones in the ring. Each partition replica
                will try to reside in a different zone. A zone could represent a
                drive, a server, a cabinet, a switch, or even a data center.</para>
    <para>The partitions of the ring are distributed among all of the devices
                in the Object Storage installation. When partitions need to be moved
                around (for example, if a device is added to the cluster), the ring
                ensures that a minimum number of partitions are moved at a time, and
                only one replica of a partition is moved at a time.</para>
    <para>You can use weights to balance the distribution of partitions on drives
                across the cluster. This can be useful, for example, when differently
                sized drives are used in a cluster.</para>
    <para>The ring is used by the proxy server and several background processes
                (like replication).</para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">The ring</emphasis>

    <para>These rings are externally managed. The server processes themselves
                do not modify the rings, they are instead given new rings modified by
                other tools.</para>
    <para>The ring uses a configurable number of bits from an <literal>MD5</literal> hash for a path
                as a partition index that designates a device. The number of bits kept
                from the hash is known as the partition power, and 2 to the partition
                power indicates the partition count. Partitioning the full <literal>MD5</literal> hash ring
                allows other parts of the cluster to work in batches of items at once
                which ends up either more efficient or at least less complex than
                working with each item separately or the entire cluster all at once.</para>
    <para>Another configurable value is the replica count, which indicates how
                many of the partition-device assignments make up a single ring. For a
                given partition index, each replica’s device will not be in the same
                zone as any other replica’s device. Zones can be used to group devices
                based on physical locations, power separations, network separations, or
                any other attribute that would improve the availability of multiple
                replicas at the same time.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Zones</title>
    <para>Object Storage allows configuring zones in order to isolate failure
                boundaries. If possible, each data replica resides in a separate zone.
                At the smallest level, a zone could be a single drive or a grouping of a
                few drives. If there were five object storage servers, then each server
                would represent its own zone. Larger deployments would have an entire
                rack (or multiple racks) of object servers, each representing a zone.
                The goal of zones is to allow the cluster to tolerate significant
                outages of storage servers without losing all replicas of the data.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Accounts and containers</title>
    <para>Each account and container is an individual SQLite database that is
                distributed across the cluster. An account database contains the list of
                containers in that account. A container database contains the list of
                objects in that container.</para>

      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>
    <para>To keep track of object data locations, each account in the system has a
                database that references all of its containers, and each container
                database references each object.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Partitions</title>
    <para>A partition is a collection of stored data. This includes account databases,
                container databases, and objects. Partitions are core to the replication
                system.</para>
    <para>Think of a partition as a bin moving throughout a fulfillment center
                warehouse. Individual orders get thrown into the bin. The system treats
                that bin as a cohesive entity as it moves throughout the system. A bin
                is easier to deal with than many little things. It makes for fewer
                moving parts throughout the system.</para>
    <para>System replicators and object uploads/downloads operate on partitions.
                As the system scales up, its behavior continues to be predictable
                because the number of partitions is a fixed number.</para>
    <para>Implementing a partition is conceptually simple: a partition is just a
                directory sitting on a disk with a corresponding hash table of what it
                contains.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Replicators</title>
    <para>In order to ensure that there are three copies of the data everywhere,
                replicators continuously examine each partition. For each local
                partition, the replicator compares it against the replicated copies in
                the other zones to see if there are any differences.</para>
    <para>The replicator knows if replication needs to take place by examining
                hashes. A hash file is created for each partition, which contains hashes
                of each directory in the partition. For a given partition, the hash files
                for each of the partition’s copies are compared. If the hashes are
                different, then it is time to replicate, and the directory that needs to
                be replicated is copied over.</para>
    <para>This is where partitions come in handy. With fewer things in the system,
                larger chunks of data are transferred around (rather than lots of little
                TCP connections, which is inefficient) and there is a consistent number
                of hashes to compare.</para>
    <para>The cluster has an eventually-consistent behavior where old data may be
                served from partitions that missed updates, but replication will cause
                all partitions to converge toward the newest data.</para>

    <para>If a zone goes down, one of the nodes containing a replica notices and
                proactively copies data to a handoff location.</para>

    <title>Use cases</title>
    <para>The following sections show use cases for object uploads and downloads
                and introduce the components.</para>
    <section>
      <title>Upload</title>
      <para>A client uses the REST API to make a HTTP request to PUT an object into
                    an existing container. The cluster receives the request. First, the
                    system must figure out where the data is going to go. To do this, the
                    account name, container name, and object name are all used to determine
                    the partition where this object should live.</para>
      <para>Then a lookup in the ring figures out which storage nodes contain the
                    partitions in question.</para>
      <para>The data is then sent to each storage node where it is placed in the
                    appropriate partition. At least two of the three writes must be
                    successful before the client is notified that the upload was successful.</para>
      <para>Next, the container database is updated asynchronously to reflect that
                    there is a new object in it.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Download</title>
      <para>A request comes in for an account/container/object. Using the same
                    consistent hashing, the partition index is determined. A lookup in the
                    ring reveals which storage nodes contain that partition. A request is
                    made to one of the storage nodes to fetch the object and, if that fails,
                    requests are made to the other nodes.</para>
