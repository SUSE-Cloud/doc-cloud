  <title>Ring-builder</title>
  <para>Use the swift-ring-builder utility to build and manage rings. This
            utility assigns partitions to devices and writes an optimized Python
            structure to a gzipped, serialized file on disk for transmission to the
            servers. The server processes occasionally check the modification time
            of the file and reload in-memory copies of the ring structure as needed.
            If you use a slightly older version of the ring, one of the three
            replicas for a partition subset will be incorrect because of the way the
            ring-builder manages changes to the ring. You can work around this
            issue.</para>
  <para>The ring-builder also keeps its own builder file with the ring
            information and additional data required to build future rings. It is
            very important to keep multiple backup copies of these builder files.
            One option is to copy the builder files out to every server while
            copying the ring files themselves. Another is to upload the builder
            files into the cluster itself. If you lose the builder file, you have to
            create a new ring from scratch. Nearly all partitions would be assigned
            to different devices and, therefore, nearly all of the stored data would
            have to be replicated to new locations. So, recovery from a builder file
            loss is possible, but data would be unreachable for an extended time.</para>
  <section>
    <title>Ring data structure</title>
    <para>The ring data structure consists of three top level fields: a list of
                devices in the cluster, a list of lists of device ids indicating
                partition to device assignments, and an integer indicating the number of
                bits to shift an MD5 hash to calculate the partition for the hash.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Partition assignment list</title>
    <para>This is a list of <literal>array('H')</literal> of devices ids. The outermost list
                contains an <literal>array('H')</literal> for each replica. Each <literal>array('H')</literal> has a
                length equal to the partition count for the ring. Each integer in the
                <literal>array('H')</literal> is an index into the above list of devices. The partition
                list is known internally to the Ring class as <literal>_replica2part2dev_id</literal>.</para>
    <para>So, to create a list of device dictionaries assigned to a partition, the
                Python code would look like:</para>
    <screen language="python">devices = [self.devs[part2dev_id[partition]] for
part2dev_id in self._replica2part2dev_id]</screen>
    <para>That code is a little simplistic because it does not account for the
                removal of duplicate devices. If a ring has more replicas than devices,
                a partition will have more than one replica on a device.</para>
    <para><literal>array('H')</literal> is used for memory conservation as there may be millions
                of partitions.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Overload</title>
    <para>The ring builder tries to keep replicas as far apart as possible while
                still respecting device weights. When it can not do both, the overload
                factor determines what happens. Each device takes an extra
                fraction of its desired partitions to allow for replica dispersion;
                after that extra fraction is exhausted, replicas are placed closer
                together than optimal.</para>
    <para>The overload factor lets the operator trade off replica
                dispersion (durability) against data dispersion (uniform disk usage).</para>
    <para>The default overload factor is 0, so device weights are strictly
                followed.</para>
    <para>With an overload factor of 0.1, each device accepts 10% more
                partitions than it otherwise would, but only if it needs to maintain
                partition dispersion.</para>
    <para>For example, consider a 3-node cluster of machines with equal-size disks;
                node A has 12 disks, node B has 12 disks, and node C has
                11 disks. The ring has an overload factor of 0.1 (10%).</para>
    <para>Without the overload, some partitions would end up with replicas only
                on nodes A and B. However, with the overload, every device can accept
                up to 10% more partitions for the sake of dispersion. The
                missing disk in C means there is one disk’s worth of partitions
                to spread across the remaining 11 disks, which gives each
                disk in C an extra 9.09% load. Since this is less than the 10%
                overload, there is one replica of each partition on each node.</para>
    <para>However, this does mean that the disks in node C have more data
                than the disks in nodes A and B. If 80% full is the warning
                threshold for the cluster, node C’s disks reach 80% full while A
                and B’s disks are only 72.7% full.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Replica counts</title>
    <para>To support the gradual change in replica counts, a ring can have a real
                number of replicas and is not restricted to an integer number of
                replicas.</para>
    <para>A fractional replica count is for the whole ring and not for individual
                partitions. It indicates the average number of replicas for each
                partition. For example, a replica count of 3.2 means that 20 percent of
                partitions have four replicas and 80 percent have three replicas.</para>
    <para>The replica count is adjustable. For example:</para>
    <screen language="console">$ swift-ring-builder account.builder set_replicas 4
$ swift-ring-builder account.builder rebalance</screen>
    <para>You must rebalance the replica ring in globally distributed clusters.
                Operators of these clusters generally want an equal number of replicas
                and regions. Therefore, when an operator adds or removes a region, the
                operator adds or removes a replica. Removing unneeded replicas saves on
                the cost of disks.</para>
    <para>You can gradually increase the replica count at a rate that does not
                adversely affect cluster performance. For example:</para>
    <screen language="console">$ swift-ring-builder object.builder set_replicas 3.01
$ swift-ring-builder object.builder rebalance
&lt;distribute rings and wait&gt;...

$ swift-ring-builder object.builder set_replicas 3.02
$ swift-ring-builder object.builder rebalance
&lt;distribute rings and wait&gt;...</screen>
    <para>Changes take effect after the ring is rebalanced. Therefore, if you
                intend to change from 3 replicas to 3.01 but you accidentally type
                2.01, no data is lost.</para>
    <para>Additionally, the <command>swift-ring-builder X.builder create</command> command can
                now take a decimal argument for the number of replicas.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Partition shift value</title>
    <para>The partition shift value is known internally to the Ring class as
                <literal>_part_shift</literal>. This value is used to shift an MD5 hash to calculate
                the partition where the data for that hash should reside. Only the top
                four bytes of the hash is used in this process. For example, to compute
                the partition for the <literal>/account/container/object</literal> path using Python:</para>
    <screen language="python">partition = unpack_from('&gt;I',
md5('/account/container/object').digest())[0] &gt;&gt;
self._part_shift</screen>
    <para>For a ring generated with part_power P, the partition shift value is
                <literal>32 - P</literal>.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Build the ring</title>
    <para>The ring builder process includes these high-level steps:</para>
    <procedure>
      <step>
        <para>The utility calculates the number of partitions to assign to each
                        device based on the weight of the device. For example, for a
                        partition at the power of 20, the ring has 1,048,576 partitions. One
                        thousand devices of equal weight each want 1,048.576 partitions. The
                        devices are sorted by the number of partitions they desire and kept
                        in order throughout the initialization process.</para>
        <note>
          <para>Each device is also assigned a random tiebreaker value that is
                            used when two devices desire the same number of partitions. This
                            tiebreaker is not stored on disk anywhere, and so two different
                            rings created with the same parameters will have different
                            partition assignments. For repeatable partition assignments,
                            <literal>RingBuilder.rebalance()</literal> takes an optional seed value that
                            seeds the Python pseudo-random number generator.</para>
        </note>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>The ring builder assigns each partition replica to the device that
                        requires most partitions at that point while keeping it as far away
                        as possible from other replicas. The ring builder prefers to assign a
                        replica to a device in a region that does not already have a replica.
                        If no such region is available, the ring builder searches for a
                        device in a different zone, or on a different server. If it does not
                        find one, it looks for a device with no replicas. Finally, if all
                        options are exhausted, the ring builder assigns the replica to the
                        device that has the fewest replicas already assigned.</para>
        <note>
          <para>The ring builder assigns multiple replicas to one device only if
                            the ring has fewer devices than it has replicas.</para>
        </note>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>When building a new ring from an old ring, the ring builder
                        recalculates the desired number of partitions that each device wants.</para>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>The ring builder unassigns partitions and gathers these partitions
                        for reassignment, as follows:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>The ring builder unassigns any assigned partitions from any
                                removed devices and adds these partitions to the gathered list.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>The ring builder unassigns any partition replicas that can be
                                spread out for better durability and adds these partitions to the
                                gathered list.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>The ring builder unassigns random partitions from any devices that
                                have more partitions than they need and adds these partitions to
                                the gathered list.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>The ring builder reassigns the gathered partitions to devices by
                        using a similar method to the one described previously.</para>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>When the ring builder reassigns a replica to a partition, the ring
                        builder records the time of the reassignment. The ring builder uses
                        this value when it gathers partitions for reassignment so that no
                        partition is moved twice in a configurable amount of time. The
                        RingBuilder class knows this configurable amount of time as
                        <literal>min_part_hours</literal>. The ring builder ignores this restriction for
                        replicas of partitions on removed devices because removal of a device
                        happens on device failure only, and reassignment is the only choice.</para>
      </step>
    </procedure>
    <para>These steps do not always perfectly rebalance a ring due to the random
                nature of gathering partitions for reassignment. To help reach a more
                balanced ring, the rebalance process is repeated until near perfect
                (less than 1 percent off) or when the balance does not improve by at
                least 1 percent (indicating we probably cannot get perfect balance due
                to wildly imbalanced zones or too many partitions recently moved).</para>
