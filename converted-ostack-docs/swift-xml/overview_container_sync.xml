  <title>Container to Container Synchronization</title>
  <section>
    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>Swift has a feature where all the contents of a container can be mirrored to
                another container through background synchronization. Swift cluster operators
                configure their cluster to allow/accept sync requests to/from other clusters,
                and the user specifies where to sync their container to along with a secret
                synchronization key.</para>
    <note>
      <para>If you are using the <xref linkend="large-objects"/> feature and
                    syncing to another cluster then you will need to ensure that manifest files
                    and segment files are synced. If segment files are in a different container
                    than their manifest then both the manifest’s container and the segments’
                    container must be synced. The target container for synced segment files
                    must always have the same name as their source container in order for them
                    to be resolved by synced manifests.</para>
      <para>Be aware that manifest files may be synced before segment files even if
                    they are in the same container and were created after the segment files.</para>
      <para>In the case of <xref linkend="static-large-objects"/>, a GET
                    request for a manifest whose segments have yet to be completely synced will
                    fail with none or only part of the large object content being returned.</para>
      <para>In the case of <xref linkend="dynamic-large-objects"/>, a GET
                    request for a manifest whose segments have yet to be completely synced will
                    either fail or return unexpected (and most likely incorrect) content.</para>
    </note>
    <note>
      <para>If you are using encryption middleware in the cluster from which objects
                    are being synced, then you should follow the instructions to configure
                    <xref linkend="container-sync-client-config"/> to be compatible with encryption.</para>

    <title>Configuring Container Sync</title>
    <para>Create a <literal>container-sync-realms.conf</literal> file specifying the allowable clusters
                and their information:</para>
    <screen>[realm1]
key = realm1key
key2 = realm1key2
cluster_clustername1 = https://host1/v1/
cluster_clustername2 = https://host2/v1/

[realm2]
key = realm2key
key2 = realm2key2
cluster_clustername3 = https://host3/v1/
cluster_clustername4 = https://host4/v1/</screen>
    <para>Each section name is the name of a sync realm. A sync realm is a set of
                clusters that have agreed to allow container syncing with each other. Realm
                names will be considered case insensitive.</para>
    <para>The key is the overall cluster-to-cluster key used in combination with the
                external users’ key that they set on their containers’
                <literal>X-Container-Sync-Key</literal> metadata header values. These keys will be used to
                sign each request the container sync daemon makes and used to validate each
                incoming container sync request.</para>
    <para>The key2 is optional and is an additional key incoming requests will be checked
                against. This is so you can rotate keys if you wish; you move the existing key
                to key2 and make a new key value.</para>
    <para>Any values in the realm section whose names begin with <literal>cluster_</literal> will
                indicate the name and endpoint of a cluster and will be used by external users in
                their containers’ <literal>X-Container-Sync-To</literal> metadata header values with the format
                “//realm_name/cluster_name/account_name/container_name”. Realm and cluster
                names are considered case insensitive.</para>
    <para>The endpoint is what the container sync daemon will use when sending out
                requests to that cluster. Keep in mind this endpoint must be reachable by all
                container servers, since that is where the container sync daemon runs. Note
                that the endpoint ends with /v1/ and that the container sync daemon will then
                add the account/container/obj name after that.</para>
    <para>Distribute this <literal>container-sync-realms.conf</literal> file to all your proxy servers
                and container servers.</para>
    <para>You also need to add the container_sync middleware to your proxy pipeline. It
                needs to be after any memcache middleware and before any auth middleware. The
                container_sync section only needs the “use” item. For example:</para>
    <screen><?dbsuse-fo font-size="8pt"?>[pipeline:main]
pipeline = healthcheck proxy-logging cache container_sync tempauth proxy-logging proxy-server

[filter:container_sync]
use = egg:swift#container_sync</screen>

    <title>Old-Style: Configuring a Cluster’s Allowable Sync Hosts</title>
    <para>This section is for the old-style of using container sync. See the previous
                section, Configuring Container Sync, for the new-style.</para>
    <para>With the old-style, the Swift cluster operator must allow synchronization with
                a set of hosts before the user can enable container synchronization. First, the
                backend container server needs to be given this list of hosts in the
                <literal>container-server.conf</literal> file:</para>
    <screen>[DEFAULT]
# This is a comma separated list of hosts allowed in the
# X-Container-Sync-To field for containers.
# allowed_sync_hosts = 127.0.0.1
allowed_sync_hosts = host1,host2,etc.
...

[container-sync]
# You can override the default log routing for this app here (don't
# use set!):
# log_name = container-sync
# log_facility = LOG_LOCAL0
# log_level = INFO
# Will sync, at most, each container once per interval
# interval = 300
# Maximum amount of time to spend syncing each container
# container_time = 60</screen>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Logging Container Sync</title>
    <para>Tracking sync progress, problems, and just general activity can only be
                achieved with log processing currently for container synchronization. In that
                light, you may wish to set the above <literal>log_</literal> options to direct the
                container-sync logs to a different file for easier monitoring. Additionally, it
                should be noted there is no way for an end user to detect sync progress or
                problems other than HEADing both containers and comparing the overall
                information.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Container Sync Statistics</title>
    <para>Container Sync INFO level logs contains activity metrics and accounting
                information foe insightful tracking.
                Currently two different statistics are collected:</para>
    <para>About once an hour or so, accumulated statistics of all operations performed
                by Container Sync are reported to the log file with the following format:
                “Since (time): (sync) synced [(delete) deletes, (put) puts], (skip) skipped,
                (fail) failed”
                time: last report time
                sync: number of containers with sync turned on that were successfully synced
                delete: number of successful DELETE object requests to the target cluster
                put: number of successful PUT object request to the target cluster
                skip: number of containers whose sync has been turned off, but are not
                yet cleared from the sync store
                fail: number of containers with failure (due to exception, timeout or other
                reason)</para>
    <para>For each container synced, per container statistics are reported with the
                following format:
                Container sync report: (container), time window start: (start), time window
                end: %(end), puts: (puts), posts: (posts), deletes: (deletes), bytes: (bytes),
                sync_point1: (point1), sync_point2: (point2), total_rows: (total)
                container: account/container statistics are for
                start: report start time
                end: report end time
                puts: number of successful PUT object requests to the target container
                posts: N/A (0)
                deletes: number of successful DELETE object requests to the target container
                bytes: number of bytes sent over the network to the target container
                point1: progress indication - the container’s x_container_sync_point1
                point2: progress indication - the container’s x_container_sync_point2
                total: number of objects processed at the container</para>
    <para>it is possible that more than one server syncs a container, therefore logfiles
                from all servers need to be evaluated</para>

      <para>You must be the account admin on the account to set synchronization targets
                    and keys.</para>
    </note>
    <para>You simply tell each container where to sync to and give it a secret
                synchronization key. First, let’s get the account details for our two cluster
                accounts:</para>
    <screen>$ swift -A http://cluster1/auth/v1.0 -U test:tester -K testing stat -v

Containers: 0
   Objects: 0
     Bytes: 0</screen>
    <para>Now, let’s make our first container and tell it to synchronize to a second
                we’ll make next:</para>
    <screen><?dbsuse-fo font-size="8pt"?>$ swift -A http://cluster1/auth/v1.0 -U test:tester -K testing post \
  -t '//realm_name/clustername2/AUTH_33cdcad8-09fb-4940-90da-0f00cbf21c7c/container2' \
  -k 'secret' container1</screen>
    <para>The <literal>-t</literal> indicates the cluster to sync to, which is the realm name of the
                section from container-sync-realms.conf, followed by the cluster name from
                that section (without the cluster_ prefix), followed by the account and container
                names we want to sync to. The <literal>-k</literal> specifies the secret key the two containers will share for
                synchronization; this is the user key, the cluster key in
                container-sync-realms.conf will also be used behind the scenes.</para>
    <para>Now, we’ll do something similar for the second cluster’s container:</para>
    <screen><?dbsuse-fo font-size="8pt"?>$ swift -A http://cluster2/auth/v1.0 -U test2:tester2 -K testing2 post \

  -k 'secret' container2</screen>
    <para>That’s it. Now we can upload a bunch of stuff to the first container and watch
                as it gets synchronized over to the second:</para>

[Nothing there yet, so we wait a bit...]</screen>
    <note>
      <para>If you’re an operator running SAIO and just testing, each time you
                    configure a container for synchronization and place objects in the
                    source container you will need to ensure that container-sync runs
                    before attempting to retrieve objects from the target container.
                    That is, you need to run:</para>
      <screen>swift-init container-sync once</screen>
    </note>
    <para>Now expect to see objects copied from the first container to the second:</para>

    <para>You can also set up a chain of synced containers if you want more than two.
                You’d point 1 -&gt; 2, then 2 -&gt; 3, and finally 3 -&gt; 1 for three containers.
                They’d all need to share the same secret synchronization key.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Using curl (or other tools) instead</title>
    <para>So what’s <literal>swift</literal> doing behind the scenes? Nothing overly complicated. It
                translates the <literal>-t &lt;value&gt;</literal> option into an <literal>X-Container-Sync-To: &lt;value&gt;</literal>
                header and the <literal>-k &lt;value&gt;</literal> option into an <literal>X-Container-Sync-Key: &lt;value&gt;</literal>
                header.</para>
    <para>For instance, when we created the first container above and told it to
                synchronize to the second, we could have used this curl command:</para>

    <title>What’s going on behind the scenes, in the cluster?</title>
    <para>Container ring devices have a directory called <literal>containers</literal>, where container
                databases reside. In addition to <literal>containers</literal>, each container ring device
                also has a directory called <literal>sync-containers</literal>. <literal>sync-containers</literal> holds
                symlinks to container databases that were configured for container sync using
                <literal>x-container-sync-to</literal> and <literal>x-container-sync-key</literal> metadata keys.</para>
    <para>The swift-container-sync process does the job of sending updates to the remote
                container. This is done by scanning <literal>sync-containers</literal> for container
                databases. For each container db found, newer rows since the last sync will
                trigger PUTs or DELETEs to the other container.</para>
    <para><literal>sync-containers</literal> is maintained as follows:
                Whenever the container-server processes a PUT or a POST request that carries
                <literal>x-container-sync-to</literal> and <literal>x-container-sync-key</literal> metadata keys the server
                creates a symlink to the container database in <literal>sync-containers</literal>. Whenever
                the container server deletes a synced container, the appropriate symlink
                is deleted from <literal>sync-containers</literal>.</para>
    <para>In addition to the container-server, the container-replicator process does the
                job of identifying containers that should be synchronized. This is done by
                scanning the local devices for container databases and checking for
                x-container-sync-to and x-container-sync-key metadata values. If they exist
                then a symlink to the container database is created in a sync-containers
                sub-directory on the same device.</para>
    <para>Similarly, when the container sync metadata keys are deleted, the container
                server and container-replicator would take care of deleting the symlinks
                from <literal>sync-containers</literal>.</para>
    <note>
      <para>The swift-container-sync process runs on each container server in the
                    cluster and talks to the proxy servers (or load balancers) in the remote
                    cluster. Therefore, the container servers must be permitted to initiate
                    outbound connections to the remote proxy servers (or load balancers).</para>
    </note>
    <para>The actual syncing is slightly more complicated to make use of the three
                (or number-of-replicas) main nodes for a container without each trying to
                do the exact same work but also without missing work if one node happens to
                be down.</para>
    <para>Two sync points are kept in each container database. When syncing a
                container, the container-sync process figures out which replica of the
                container it has. In a standard 3-replica scenario, the process will
                have either replica number 0, 1, or 2. This is used to figure out
                which rows are belong to this sync process and which ones don’t.</para>
    <para>An example may help. Assume a replica count of 3 and database row IDs
                are 1..6. Also, assume that container-sync is running on this
                container for the first time, hence SP1 = SP2 = -1.</para>
    <screen>SP1
SP2
 |
 v
-1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6</screen>
    <para>First, the container-sync process looks for rows with id between SP1
                and SP2. Since this is the first run, SP1 = SP2 = -1, and there aren’t
                any such rows.</para>
    <screen>SP1
SP2
 |
 v
-1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6</screen>
    <para>Second, the container-sync process looks for rows with id greater than
                SP1, and syncs those rows which it owns. Ownership is based on the
                hash of the object name, so it’s not always guaranteed to be exactly
                one out of every three rows, but it usually gets close. For the sake
                of example, let’s say that this process ends up owning rows 2 and 5.</para>
    <para>Once it’s finished trying to sync those rows, it updates SP1 to be the
                biggest row-id that it’s seen, which is 6 in this example.</para>
    <screen>SP2           SP1
 |             |
 v             v
-1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6</screen>
    <para>While all that was going on, clients uploaded new objects into the
                container, creating new rows in the database.</para>
    <screen>SP2           SP1
 |             |
 v             v
-1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12</screen>
    <para>On the next run, the container-sync starts off looking at rows with
                ids between SP1 and SP2. This time, there are a bunch of them. The
                sync process try to sync all of them. If it succeeds, it will set
                SP2 to equal SP1. If it fails, it will set SP2 to the failed object
                and will continue to try all other objects till SP1, setting SP2 to
                the first object that failed.</para>
    <para>Under normal circumstances, the container-sync processes
                will have already taken care of synchronizing all rows, between SP1
                and SP2, resulting in a set of quick checks.
                However, if one of the sync
                processes failed for some reason, then this is a vital fallback to
                make sure all the objects in the container get synchronized. Without
                this seemingly-redundant work, any container-sync failure results in
                unsynchronized objects. Note that the container sync will persistently
                retry to sync any faulty object until success, while logging each failure.</para>
    <para>Once it’s done with the fallback rows, and assuming no faults occurred,
                SP2 is advanced to SP1.</para>
    <screen>              SP2
              SP1
               |
               v
-1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12</screen>
    <para>Then, rows with row ID greater than SP1 are synchronized (provided
                this container-sync process is responsible for them), and SP1 is moved
                up to the greatest row ID seen.</para>
    <screen>              SP2            SP1
               |              |
               v              v
-1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12</screen>
