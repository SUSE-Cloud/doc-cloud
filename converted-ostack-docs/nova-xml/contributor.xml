  <title>Contributor Documentation</title>
  <para>Contributing to nova gives you the power to help add features, fix bugs,
            enhance documentation, and increase testing. Contributions of any type are
            valuable, and part of what keeps the project going. Here are a list of
            resources to get your started.</para>

    <title>Nova Process</title>
    <para>The nova community is a large community. We have lots of users, and they all
                have a lot of expectations around upgrade and backwards compatibility.  For
                example, having a good stable API, with discoverable versions and capabilities
                is important for maintaining the strong ecosystem around Nova.</para>
    <para>Our process is always evolving, just as nova and the community around Nova
                evolves over time. If there are things that seem strange, or you have ideas on
                how to improve things, please bring them forward on IRC or the openstack-dev
                mailing list, so we continue to improve how the nova community operates.</para>
    <para>This section looks at the processes and why. The main aim behind all the
                process is to aid communication between all members of the nova community,
                while keeping users happy and keeping developers productive.</para>
