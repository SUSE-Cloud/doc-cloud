  <title>Install and configure a compute node</title>
  <para>This section describes how to install and configure the Compute service on a
            compute node for Ubuntu, openSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise,
            and Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS.</para>
  <para>The service supports several hypervisors to deploy instances or
            virtual machines (VMs). For simplicity, this configuration uses the Quick
            EMUlator (QEMU) hypervisor with the kernel-based VM (KVM) extension on compute
            nodes that support hardware acceleration for virtual machines.  On legacy
            hardware, this configuration uses the generic QEMU hypervisor.  You can follow
            these instructions with minor modifications to horizontally scale your
            environment with additional compute nodes.</para>
  <note>
    <para>This section assumes that you are following the instructions in this guide
                step-by-step to configure the first compute node. If you want to configure
                additional compute nodes, prepare them in a similar fashion to the first
                compute node in the <xref linkend="overview-example-architectures"/> section. Each additional compute node
                requires a unique IP address.</para>
