  <title>Technical Reference Deep Dives</title>
  <para>The nova project is large, and there are lots of complicated parts in it where
            it helps to have an overview to understand how the internals of a particular
            part work.</para>

    <title>Forward Looking Plans</title>
    <para>The following section includes documents that describe the overall plan behind
                groups of nova-specs. Most of these cover items relating to the evolution of
                various parts of nova's architecture. Once the work is complete,
                these documents will move into the "Internals" section.</para>
    <para>If you want to get involved in shaping the future of nova's architecture,
                these are a great place to start reading up on the current plans.</para>
