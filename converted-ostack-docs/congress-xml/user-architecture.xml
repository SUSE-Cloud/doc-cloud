  <para>Congress consists of the Congress policy engine and a driver for any number of
            other cloud services that act as sources of information about the cloud:</para>

    <title>1. Cloud Services, Drivers, and State</title>
    <para>A service is anything that manages cloud state.  For example,
                OpenStack components like Nova, Neutron, Cinder, Swift, Heat, and
                Keystone are all services.  Software like ActiveDirectory, inventory management
                systems, anti-virus scanners, intrusion detection systems, and
                relational databases are also services.</para>
    <para>Congress uses a driver to connect each service to the policy engine.
                A driver fetches cloud state from its respective cloud service, and
                then feeds that state to the policy engine in the form of tables.
                A table is a collection of rows; each row is a collection of columns;
                each row-column entry stores simple data like numbers or strings.</para>
    <para>For example, the Nova driver periodically makes API calls to Nova to fetch
                the list of virtual machines in the cloud, and the properties
                associated with each VM.  The Nova driver then populates a table in
                the policy engine with the Nova state.  For example, the Nova driver
                populates a table like this::</para>
    <screen>---------------------------------------------
| VM id | Name | Status | Power State | ... |
---------------------------------------------
| 12345 | foo  | ACTIVE | Running     | ... |
| ...   |      |        |             |     |
---------------------------------------------</screen>
    <para>The state for each service will be unique to that service.  For
                Neutron, the existing logical networks, subnets, and ports make up
                that state.  For Nova, the existing VMs along with their disk and
                memory space make up that state.  For an anti-virus scanner, the
                results of all its most recent scans are the state.  The
                <xref linkend="cloudservices"/> section describes services and drivers in
                more detail.</para>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="policy">
    <title>2. Policy</title>
    <para>A Congress policy defines all those states of the cloud that are permitted:
                all those combinations of service tables that are possible when the cloud is
                behaving as intended.  Since listing the permitted states explicitly is an
                insurmountable task, policy authors describe the permitted states implicitly
                by writing a collection of if-then statements that are always true when the
                cloud is behaving as intended.</para>
    <para>More precisely, Congress uses Datalog as its policy language.  Datalog is a
                declarative language and is similar in many ways to SQL, Prolog, and
                first-order logic.  Datalog has been the subject of research and
                development for the past 50 years, which means there is
                a wealth of tools, algorithms, and deployment experience surrounding it.
                The <xref linkend="policy"/> section describes policies in more detail.</para>

    <title>3. Capabilities</title>
    <para>Once Congress is given a policy, it has three
                capabilities:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>monitoring the cloud for policy violations</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>preventing violations before they occur</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>correcting violations after they occur</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>In the future, Congress will also record the history of policy and its
                violations for the purpose of audit.
                The <xref linkend="enforcement"/> section describes
                these capabilities in more detail.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>4. Congress Server and API</title>
    <para>Congress runs as a standalone server process and presents a RESTful
                API for clients; drivers run as part of the server.
                Instructions for installing and starting the Congress server can be
                found in the <xref linkend="readme"/> file.</para>
    <para>The API allows clients to perform the following operations:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>insert and delete policy statements</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>check for policy violations</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>ask hypothetical questions: if the cloud were to undergo these changes,
                        would that cause any policy violations?</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>execute actions</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>The <xref linkend="api"/> section describes the API in more detail.</para>
