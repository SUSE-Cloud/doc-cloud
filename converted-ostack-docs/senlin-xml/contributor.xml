    <title>About Global Requirements</title>
    <para>When reviewing patches proposed by <literal>OpenStack Proposal Bot</literal>, we often quick
                approve them if the patch successfully passed the gate jobs. However, we
                should realize that these tests may contain some improvements or radical
                changes to the packages senlin imports.</para>
    <para>A more appropriate workflow should be checking the version changes proposed
                in such patches and examine the git log from each particular package. If there
                are significant changes that may simplify senlin code base, we should propose
                at least a TODO item to write down the needed changes to senlin so we adapt
                senlin code to the new package.</para>

    <title>About Trivial Changes</title>
    <para>There are always disagreements across the community about trivial changes such
                as grammar fixes, mis-spelling changes in comments etc. These changes are in
                general okay to get merged, BUT our core reviewers should be aware that these
                behavior are not encouraged. When we notice such behavior from some
                developers, it is our responsibility to guide these developers to submit more
                useful patches. We are not supposed to reject such changes as a punishment or
                something like that. We are about building a great software with a great team.</para>
