    <para>Our community welcomes all people interested in open source cloud computing,
                and there are no formal membership requirements. The best way to join the
                community is to talk with others online or at a meetup and offer contributions
                through <link xlink:href="https://launchpad.net/keystone">Launchpad</link>, the <link xlink:href="https://wiki.openstack.org/">wiki</link>, or blogs. We welcome all types of contributions,

      <title>#openstack-keystone on Freenode IRC Network</title>
      <para>You can find Keystone folks in <link xlink:href="irc://freenode.net/#openstack-keystone"/>.
                    This is usually the best place to ask questions and find your way around. IRC
                    stands for Internet Relay Chat and it is a way to chat online in real time.
                    You can also ask a question and come back to the log files to read the answer
                    later. Logs for the #openstack IRC channels are stored at
                    <link xlink:href="http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/irclogs/"/>.</para>
