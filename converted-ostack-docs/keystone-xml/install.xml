  <para>The OpenStack system consists of several key services that are separately
            installed. These services work together depending on your cloud
            needs and include the Compute, Identity, Networking, Image, Block Storage,
            Object Storage, Telemetry, Orchestration, and Database services. You
            can install any of these projects separately and configure them stand-alone
            or as connected entities.</para>
  <para>This section describes how to install and configure the OpenStack
            Identity service, code-named keystone, on the controller node. For
            scalability purposes, this configuration deploys Fernet tokens and
            the Apache HTTP server to handle requests.</para>
