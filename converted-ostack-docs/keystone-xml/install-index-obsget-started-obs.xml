  <title>Identity service overview</title>
  <para>The OpenStack Identity service provides a single point of integration for
            managing authentication, authorization, and a catalog of services.</para>
  <para>The Identity service is typically the first service a user interacts with. Once
            authenticated, an end user can use their identity to access other OpenStack
            services. Likewise, other OpenStack services leverage the Identity service to
            ensure users are who they say they are and discover where other services are
            within the deployment. The Identity service can also integrate with some
            external user management systems (such as LDAP).</para>
  <para>Users and services can locate other services by using the service catalog,
            which is managed by the Identity service. As the name implies, a service
            catalog is a collection of available services in an OpenStack deployment. Each
            service can have one or many endpoints and each endpoint can be one of three
            types: admin, internal, or public. In a production environment, different
            endpoint types might reside on separate networks exposed to different types of
            users for security reasons. For instance, the public API network might be
            visible from the Internet so customers can manage their clouds. The admin API
            network might be restricted to operators within the organization that manages
            cloud infrastructure. The internal API network might be restricted to the hosts
            that contain OpenStack services. Also, OpenStack supports multiple regions for
            scalability. For simplicity, this guide uses the management network for all
            endpoint types and the default <literal>RegionOne</literal> region. Together, regions,
            services, and endpoints created within the Identity service comprise the
            service catalog for a deployment. Each OpenStack service in your deployment
            needs a service entry with corresponding endpoints stored in the Identity
            service. This can all be done after the Identity service has been installed and
            configured.</para>
  <para>The Identity service contains these components:</para>

      <term>Server</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>A centralized server provides authentication and authorization
                        services using a RESTful interface.</para>

    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Drivers</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Drivers or a service back end are integrated to the centralized
                        server. They are used for accessing identity information in
                        repositories external to OpenStack, and may already exist in
                        the infrastructure where OpenStack is deployed (for example, SQL
                        databases or LDAP servers).</para>

    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Modules</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Middleware modules run in the address space of the OpenStack
                        component that is using the Identity service. These modules
                        intercept service requests, extract user credentials, and send them
                        to the centralized server for authorization. The integration between
                        the middleware modules and OpenStack components uses the Python Web
                        Server Gateway Interface.</para>
