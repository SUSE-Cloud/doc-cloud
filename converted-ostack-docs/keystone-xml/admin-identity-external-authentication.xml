  <title>External authentication with Identity</title>
  <para>When Identity runs in <literal>apache-httpd</literal>, you can use external
            authentication methods that differ from the authentication provided by
            the identity store back end. For example, you can use an SQL identity
            back end together with X.509 authentication and Kerberos, instead of
            using the user name and password combination.</para>

    <title>Use HTTPD authentication</title>
    <para>Web servers, like Apache HTTP, support many methods of authentication.
                Identity can allow the web server to perform the authentication. The web
                server then passes the authenticated user to Identity by using the
                <literal>REMOTE_USER</literal> environment variable. This user must already exist in
                the Identity back end to get a token from the controller. To use this
                method, Identity should run on <literal>apache-httpd</literal>.</para>

    <title>Use X.509</title>
    <para>The following Apache configuration snippet authenticates the user based
                on a valid X.509 certificate from a known CA:</para>
    <screen language="none">&lt;VirtualHost _default_:5000&gt;
    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile    /etc/ssl/certs/ssl.cert
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/ssl.key

    SSLCACertificatePath /etc/ssl/allowed_cas
    SSLCARevocationPath  /etc/ssl/allowed_cas
    SSLUserName          SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_CN
    SSLVerifyClient      require
    SSLVerifyDepth       10

    (...)
