    <para>This error occurs if the 3PAR host exists with the correct host name
                that the OpenStack Block Storage drivers expect but the volume was

    <title>Solution</title>
    <para>The <literal>hpe3par_domain</literal> configuration items either need to be updated to
                use the domain the 3PAR host currently resides in, or the 3PAR host
                needs to be moved to the domain that the volume was created in.</para>
