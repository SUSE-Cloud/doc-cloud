  <title>Increase Block Storage API service throughput</title>
  <para>By default, the Block Storage API service runs in one process. This
            limits the number of API requests that the Block Storage service can
            process at any given time. In a production environment, you should
            increase the Block Storage API throughput by allowing the Block Storage
            API service to run in as many processes as the machine capacity allows.</para>
  <note>
    <para>The Block Storage API service is named <literal>openstack-cinder-api</literal> on
                the following distributions: CentOS, Fedora, openSUSE, Red Hat
                Enterprise Linux, and SUSE Linux Enterprise. In Ubuntu and Debian
                distributions, the Block Storage API service is named <literal>cinder-api</literal>.</para>
  </note>
  <para>To do so, use the Block Storage API service option <literal>osapi_volume_workers</literal>.
            This option allows you to specify the number of API service workers
            (or OS processes) to launch for the Block Storage API service.</para>
  <para>To configure this option, open the <literal>/etc/cinder/cinder.conf</literal>
            configuration file and set the <literal>osapi_volume_workers</literal> configuration
            key to the number of CPU cores/threads on a machine.</para>
  <para>On distributions that include <literal>openstack-config</literal>, you can configure
            this by running the following command instead:</para>
  <screen language="console"># openstack-config --set /etc/cinder/cinder.conf \
  DEFAULT osapi_volume_workers CORES</screen>
  <para>Replace <literal>CORES</literal> with the number of CPU cores/threads on a machine.</para>
