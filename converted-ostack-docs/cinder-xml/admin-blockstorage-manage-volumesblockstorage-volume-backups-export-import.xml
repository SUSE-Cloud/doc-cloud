  <title>Export and import backup metadata</title>
  <para>A volume backup can only be restored on the same Block Storage service. This
            is because restoring a volume from a backup requires metadata available on
            the database used by the Block Storage service.</para>
  <note>
    <para>For information about how to back up and restore a volume, see
                the section called <xref linkend="volume-backups"/>.</para>
  </note>
  <para>You can, however, export the metadata of a volume backup. To do so, run
            this command as an OpenStack <literal>admin</literal> user (presumably, after creating
            a volume backup):</para>
  <screen language="console">$ cinder backup-export BACKUP_ID</screen>
  <para>Where <literal>BACKUP_ID</literal> is the volume backup’s ID. This command should return the
            backup’s corresponding database information as encoded string metadata.</para>
  <para>Exporting and storing this encoded string metadata allows you to completely
            restore the backup, even in the event of a catastrophic database failure.
            This will preclude the need to back up the entire Block Storage database,
            particularly if you only need to keep complete backups of a small subset
            of volumes.</para>
  <para>If you have placed encryption on your volumes, the encryption will still be
            in place when you restore the volume if a UUID encryption key is specified
            when creating volumes. Using backup metadata support, UUID keys set up for
            a volume (or volumes) will remain valid when you restore a backed-up volume.
            The restored volume will remain encrypted, and will be accessible with your
            credentials.</para>
  <para>In addition, having a volume backup and its backup metadata also provides
            volume portability. Specifically, backing up a volume and exporting its
            metadata will allow you to restore the volume on a completely different Block
            Storage database, or even on a different cloud service. To do so, first
            import the backup metadata to the Block Storage database and then restore
            the backup.</para>
  <para>To import backup metadata, run the following command as an OpenStack
            <literal>admin</literal>:</para>
  <screen language="console">$ cinder backup-import METADATA</screen>
  <para>Where <literal>METADATA</literal> is the backup metadata exported earlier.</para>
  <para>Once you have imported the backup metadata into a Block Storage database,
            restore the volume (see the section called <xref linkend="volume-backups"/>).</para>
