    <title>Problem</title>
    <para>This error could be caused by a volume being exported outside of
                OpenStack using a host name different from the system name that
                OpenStack expects. This error could be displayed with the <xref linkend="term-iscsi-qualified-name-iqn"/> if the host was exported using iSCSI.</para>

    <title>Solution</title>
    <para>Host names constructed by the driver use just the local host name, not
                the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the Compute host. For example,
                if the FQDN was <emphasis role="bold">myhost.example.com</emphasis>, just <emphasis role="bold">myhost</emphasis> would be used as the
                3PAR host name. IP addresses are not allowed as host names on the 3PAR
                storage server.</para>
