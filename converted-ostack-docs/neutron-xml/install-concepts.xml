  <title>Networking (neutron) concepts</title>
  <para>OpenStack Networking (neutron) manages all networking facets for the
            Virtual Networking Infrastructure (VNI) and the access layer aspects
            of the Physical Networking Infrastructure (PNI) in your OpenStack
            environment. OpenStack Networking enables projects to create advanced
            virtual network topologies which may include services such as a
            firewall, a load balancer, and a virtual private network (VPN).</para>
  <para>Networking provides networks, subnets, and routers as object abstractions.
            Each abstraction has functionality that mimics its physical counterpart:
            networks contain subnets, and routers route traffic between different
            subnets and networks.</para>
  <para>Any given Networking set up has at least one external network. Unlike
            the other networks, the external network is not merely a virtually
            defined network. Instead, it represents a view into a slice of the
            physical, external network accessible outside the OpenStack
            installation. IP addresses on the external network are accessible by
            anybody physically on the outside network.</para>
  <para>In addition to external networks, any Networking set up has one or more
            internal networks. These software-defined networks connect directly to
            the VMs. Only the VMs on any given internal network, or those on subnets
            connected through interfaces to a similar router, can access VMs connected
            to that network directly.</para>
  <para>For the outside network to access VMs, and vice versa, routers between
            the networks are needed. Each router has one gateway that is connected
            to an external network and one or more interfaces connected to internal
            networks. Like a physical router, subnets can access machines on other
            subnets that are connected to the same router, and machines can access the
            outside network through the gateway for the router.</para>
  <para>Additionally, you can allocate IP addresses on external networks to
            ports on the internal network. Whenever something is connected to a
            subnet, that connection is called a port. You can associate external
            network IP addresses with ports to VMs. This way, entities on the
            outside network can access VMs.</para>
  <para>Networking also supports <emphasis>security groups</emphasis>. Security groups enable
            administrators to define firewall rules in groups. A VM can belong to
            one or more security groups, and Networking applies the rules in those
            security groups to block or unblock ports, port ranges, or traffic types
            for that VM.</para>
  <para>Each plug-in that Networking uses has its own concepts. While not vital
            to operating the VNI and OpenStack environment, understanding these
            concepts can help you set up Networking. All Networking installations
            use a core plug-in and a security group plug-in (or just the No-Op
            security group plug-in). Additionally, Firewall-as-a-Service (FWaaS) and
            Load-Balancer-as-a-Service (LBaaS) plug-ins are available.</para>
