  <title>Networking service overview</title>
  <para>OpenStack Networking (neutron) allows you to create and attach interface
            devices managed by other OpenStack services to networks. Plug-ins can be
            implemented to accommodate different networking equipment and software,
            providing flexibility to OpenStack architecture and deployment.</para>
  <para>It includes the following components:</para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>neutron-server</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Accepts and routes API requests to the appropriate OpenStack
                        Networking plug-in for action.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>OpenStack Networking plug-ins and agents</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Plug and unplug ports, create networks or subnets, and provide
                        IP addressing. These plug-ins and agents differ depending on the
                        vendor and technologies used in the particular cloud. OpenStack
                        Networking ships with plug-ins and agents for Cisco virtual and
                        physical switches, NEC OpenFlow products, Open vSwitch, Linux
                        bridging, and the VMware NSX product.</para>
        <para>The common agents are L3 (layer 3), DHCP (dynamic host IP
                        addressing), and a plug-in agent.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Messaging queue</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>Used by most OpenStack Networking installations to route information
                        between the neutron-server and various agents. Also acts as a database
                        to store networking state for particular plug-ins.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>
  <para>OpenStack Networking mainly interacts with OpenStack Compute to provide
            networks and connectivity for its instances.</para>
