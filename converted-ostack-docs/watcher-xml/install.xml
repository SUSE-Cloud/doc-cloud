  <para>The Infrastructure Optimization service (watcher) provides
            flexible and scalable resource optimization service for
            multi-tenant OpenStack-based clouds.</para>
  <para>Watcher provides a complete optimization loop including
            everything from a metrics receiver, complex event processor
            and profiler, optimization processor and an action plan
            applier. This provides a robust framework to realize a wide
            range of cloud optimization goals, including the reduction
            of data center operating costs, increased system performance
            via intelligent virtual machine migration, increased energy
            efficiencyâ€”and more!</para>
  <para>Watcher also supports a pluggable architecture by which custom
            optimization algorithms, data metrics and data profilers can be
            developed and inserted into the Watcher framework.</para>
