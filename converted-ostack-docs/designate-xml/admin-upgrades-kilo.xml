    <procedure>
      <step>
        <para>Two new Designate services</para>
      </step>
    </procedure>
    <para>Two new Designate services were added in Kilo, designate-pool-manager and
                designate-mdns. Please ensure to configure and enable these services as
                part of the upgrade.</para>
    <para>2. Post-Migration, existing DNS domains hosted by PowerDNS must have their
                “masters” column manually populated with the list of designate-mdns ip and
                port pairs, and their type switched to SECONDARY. For example:</para>
    <screen language="ruby"><?dbsuse-fo font-size="8pt"?>UPDATE powerdns.domains SET type = "SECONDARY", masters = "192.0.2.1:5354,192.0.2.2:5354" WHERE masters IS NULL;</screen>
