 <para>
  The reconfigure process can be triggered again from the deployer. Presuming
  that changes have been made to the variables in the appropriate places
  execution of the respective ansible scripts will be enough to update the
  configuration. The spark reconfigure process alters the nodes serially
  meaning that spark is never down altogether, each node is stopped in turn
  and zookeeper manages the leaders accordingly. This means that
  monasca-transform may be left running even while spark is upgraded.
