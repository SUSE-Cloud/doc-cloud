<title>Generate SUSE &ostack; Cloud Self Signed Certificate</title>
 <para>
   The purpose of this document is to help setup SSL Support for several services
   in SUSE OpenStack Cloud. The scope of this document will cover all public
   endpoints in your OpenStack cluster. In most cases you will want to have a
   Secure CA or External CA where your certificates are signed. You will
   sign with either a public CA or self signed CA, and include x509
   extensions for Subject Alt Names since there might be a highly available
   control plane with alternate names.

 <section xml:id="create-root-pair">
   <title>Create the CA Root Pair</title>
   <para>This section demonstrates how to create the certificate on the
     crowbar or admin node of the SUSE OpenStack Cloud Cluster.</para>
     <note>
       <para>
         To avoid external access to your CA Root Pair, it is best practice to
         put it on an air-gapped system that is permanently isolated from the
         internet at least and to unplug the ethernet port.
       </para>
     </note>
     <procedure>
       <title>Prepare the directory structure</title>
       <step>
         <para>
           Create a directory for your CA Root pair:
         </para>
         <screen>
           # ssh root@crowbar
           # mkdir -p ~/ssl/root/ca
         </screen>
       </step>
       <step>
         <para>
           Create a directory structure and add <filename>index.txt</filename>
           and serial files to act as flat database of all signed certificates:
         </para>
         <screen>
           # cd ~/ssl/root/ca
           # mkdir certs crl newcerts private csr
           # chmod 700 private
           # touch index.txt
           # echo 1000 > serial
         </screen>
       </step>
     </procedure>
     <procedure>
       <title>Prepare the configuration file</title>
       <para>
         This procedure will take you through the full setup. Note that
         when you setup the crowbar server there is a structure already setup
         under <literal>/etc/ssl</literal>. This is where SUSE Linux typically
         contains the CA cert bundle created through YaST when the SMT server
         is setup. However, if your using an external SMT server
         you won’t have this. Also, in the same location an
         <literal>openssl.cnf</literal> file already
         exists,which we will create in this step.
       </para>
       <step>
         <para>
           Copy <literal>/etc/ssl/openssl.cnf</literal> file to your setup.
           We can use this since it is completely annotated.
         </para>
         <screen>
           # cp /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf ./
         </screen>
       </step>
       <step>
         <para>
           Edit the file and change the location variable:
         </para>
         <screen>
           dir             = /root/ssl/root/ca
           # Where everything is kept
         </screen>
         <note>
           <para>
             Make sure dir is the directory we created /root/ssl/root/ca
           </para>

    </procedure>
    <procedure>
      <title>Create the root key</title>
      <step>
        <para>
          Create the root key encrypted with AES 256-bit encryption
          and a password, using 4096 bits for the creation.
        </para>
        <screen>
          # cd ~/ssl/root/ca

      </step>

   <procedure>
     <title>Create the root certificates</title>
       <step>
         <para>
           Use the root key (<literal>cakey.pem</literal>) to create the
           root certificate (cacert.pem). Its important to give it a long
           expiration since all the certificates signed from it will
           become invalid once it expires.
         </para>
         <screen>
           # cd ~/ssl/root/ca
           # openssl req -config openssl.cnf -key private/cakey.pem -new -x509 -days 10950 -sha256 -extensions v3_ca -out cacert.pem
           Enter pass phrase for cakey.pem: enteryourpassword
           You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
           into your certificate request.

          If you had haproxy setup for your cluster or pacemaker, you have a
          cluster URL. For example, you may have
          <literal>public.cluster.your_domain.com</literal> and you need to
          have <literal>cluster.your_domain.com</literal> and <literal>public.cluster.your_domain.com</literal>
