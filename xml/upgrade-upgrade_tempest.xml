 <title>Upgrade Tempest as Service</title>
 <para>
  In &kw-hos-phrase;, Tempest has been modelled as a service and this gives you
  the ability to locate Tempest anywhere in the cloud. It is recommended that
  you install Tempest on your &clm; node as that is where it
  resides by default in a new installation.
 </para>
 <para>
  When you are upgrading from &kw-hos-phrase; 3.0, you must add
  <literal>tempest</literal> as a service in you cloud definition after the
  upgrade completes. Typically, you will add an entry in the file
