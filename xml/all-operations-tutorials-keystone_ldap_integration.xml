 <title>Integrating &kw-hos; with an LDAP System</title>
 <para>
  You can configure your &kw-hos; cloud to work with an outside user
  authentication source such as Active Directory or OpenLDAP. Keystone, the
  Helion OpenStack identity service, functions as the first stop for any user
  authorization/authentication requests. Keystone can also function as a proxy
  for user account authentication, passing along authentication and
  authorization requests to any LDAP-enabled system that has been configured
  as an outside source. This type of integration lets you use an existing
  user-management system such as Active Directory and its powerful group-based
  organization features as a source for permissions in &kw-hos;.
 </para>
 <para>
  Upon successful completion of this tutorial, your cloud will refer user
  authentication requests to an outside LDAP-enabled directory system, such as
  Microsoft Active Directory or OpenLDAP.
