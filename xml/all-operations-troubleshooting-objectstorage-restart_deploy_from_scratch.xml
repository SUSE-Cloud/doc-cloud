    <sidebar><title>To Restart the Swift Object Storage Deployment </title><para>The structure of ring is built in an incremental stages. When you modify a ring, the new
        ring uses the state of the old ring as a basis for the new ring. Rings are stored in the
        builder file. The <literal>swiftlm-ring-supervisor</literal> stores builder files in the
          <literal>/etc/swiftlm/builder_dir/region-&lt;region-name&gt;</literal> directory on the
        Ring-Builder node. The builder files are named &lt;ring-name&gt; builder. Prior versions of the
        builder files are stored in the
          <literal>/etc/swiftlm/builder_dir/region-&lt;region-name&gt;/backups</literal> directory.</para>
<para>Generally, you use an existing builder file as the basis for changes to a ring. However, at
        initial deployment, when you create a ring there will be no builder file. Instead, the first
        step in the process is to build a builder file. The deploy playbook does this as a part of
        the deployment process. If you have successfully deployed some of the system, the ring
        builder files will exist. </para>
<para>If you change your input model (for example, by adding servers) now, the process assumes
        you are <emphasis>modifying</emphasis> a ring and behaves differently than while creating a ring from
        scratch. In this case, the ring is not balanced. So, if the cloud model contains an error or
        you decide to make substantive changes, it is a best practice to start from scratch and
        build rings using the steps in "To Reset Builder Files" below.</para>
