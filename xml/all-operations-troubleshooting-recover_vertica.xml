        <para>In &kw-hos-phrase;, the monitoring service uses Vertica as its database. If it is
                configured incorrectly, or if a higher than expected load is experienced, and the
                file system fills up then Vertica may fall over and need to be recreated. In these
                cases you will need to recreate the Vertica database as described below.</para>

        <para>Prior to getting to that point you may see the <literal>Disk Usage</literal> alarm
                trigger, which is a sign that the file system is filling up. If you can resolve this
                issue quickly using the steps below then you can prevent the Vertica database
                failure.</para>
