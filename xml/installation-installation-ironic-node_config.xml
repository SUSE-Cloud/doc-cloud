  <title>DHCP</title>
  <para>
   Once booted, nodes obtain network configuration via DHCP. If multiple
   interfaces are to be utilized, you may want to pre-build images with
   settings to execute DHCP on all interfaces. An easy way to build custom
   images is with the OpenStack

   utility. For more information, see the

   documentation</link>.

  <title>Configuration Drives</title>

   <para>
    Configuration Drives are stored unencrypted and should not include any
    sensitive data.

   Users may wish to utilize
   <link xlink:href="http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/cli_config_drive.html">Configuration
   Drives</link> to store metadata for initial boot setting customization.
   While Configuration Drives are extremely useful for initial machine
   configuration, as a general security practice, they should not include any
   sensitive data. Configuration Drives should only be trusted upon the initial
   boot of an instance. <literal>cloud-init</literal> utilizes a lock file for
   this purpose. Custom instance images should not rely upon the integrity of a
   Configuration Drive beyond the initial boot of a host as an administrative
   user within a deployed instance can potentially modify a configuration drive
   once written to disk and released for use.
