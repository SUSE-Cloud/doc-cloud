  <title>DHCP</title>
  <para>
   Once booted, nodes obtain network configuration via DHCP. If multiple
   interfaces are to be utilized, you may want to pre-build images with
   settings to execute DHCP on all interfaces. An easy way to build custom
   images is with &kiwi;, the command line utility to build Linux system
   appliances.
  </para>
  <para>
   For information about building custom &kiwi; images, see
   <xref linkend="sec-ironic-provision-kiwi"/>.

  <title>Configuration Drives</title>
  <warning>
   <para>
    Configuration Drives are stored unencrypted and should not include any
    sensitive data.
   </para>
  </warning>
  <para>
   You can use Configuration Drives to store metadata for initial boot
   setting customization. Configuration Drives are extremely useful for
   initial machine configuration. However, as a general security practice,
   they should not include any
   sensitive data. Configuration Drives should only be trusted upon the initial
   boot of an instance. <literal>cloud-init</literal> utilizes a lock file for
   this purpose. Custom instance images should not rely upon the integrity of a
   Configuration Drive beyond the initial boot of a host as an administrative
   user within a deployed instance can potentially modify a configuration drive
   once written to disk and released for use.
