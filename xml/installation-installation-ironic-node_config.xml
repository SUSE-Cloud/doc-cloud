<bridgehead renderas="sect4">DHCP</bridgehead><para>Once booted, nodes obtain network configuration via DHCP.  If multiple interfaces are to be utilized, 
        a user may wish to pre-build images with settings to execute DHCP on all interfaces.  An easy utility 
        to build custom images is the <link xlink:href="https://github.com/openstack/diskimage-builder">diskimage-builder</link> 
        utility which has a <link xlink:href="https://github.com/openstack/diskimage-builder/tree/master/elements/dhcp-all-interfaces">dhcp-all-interfaces</link> element that can 
        be utilized to initiate DHCP on all interfaces.</para>
<para>The diskimage-builder tool does not support building UEFI images. The following patchset can be used to build UEFI images:

</caution><para>Users may wish to utilize 
        <link xlink:href="http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/cli_config_drive.html">Configuration Drives</link> 
        to store metadata for initial boot setting customization.  While Configuration Drives are extremely useful for 
        initial machine configuration, as a general security practice, they should not include any sensitive data. 
        Configuration Drives should only be trusted upon the initial boot of an instance. <literal>cloud-init</literal> utilizes a 
        lock file for this purpose. Custom instance images should not rely upon the integrity of a Configuration 
        Drive beyond the initial boot of a host as an administrative user with-in a deployed instance can potentially
        modify a configuration drive once written to disk and released for use.</para>
