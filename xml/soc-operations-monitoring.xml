 <para>
  As more and more applications are deployed on cloud systems and cloud systems
  are growing in complexity, managing the cloud infrastructure is becoming
  increasingly difficult. <phrase>SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</phrase>
  helps mastering this challenge by providing a sophisticated Monitoring as a
  Service solution that is operated on top of OpenStack-based cloud computing
  platforms.
 </para>
 <para>
  The component architecture of OpenStack provides for high flexibility, yet it
  increases the burden of system operation because multiple services must be
  handled. <phrase>SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</phrase> offers an
  integrated view of all services and assembles and presents related metrics
  and log data in one convenient access point. While being flexible and
  scalable to instantly reflect changes in the OpenStack platform, <phrase>SUSE
  OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</phrase> provides the ways and means required to
  ensure multi-tenancy, high availability, and data security. The high
  availability architecture of <phrase>SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</phrase>
  ensures an optimum level of operational performance eliminating the risk of
  component failures and providing for reliable crossover.
 </para>
 <para>
  <phrase>SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</phrase> covers all aspects of a
  Monitoring as a Service solution:

    Horizontal and vertical scalability to support constantly evolving cloud
    infrastructures. When physical and virtual servers are scaled up or down to
    varying loads, the monitoring and log management solution can be adapted
    accordingly.
