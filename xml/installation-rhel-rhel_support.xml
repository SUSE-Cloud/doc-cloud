    <para>
     &vendor; customers who have purchased both &kw-hos; and &rhla; subscriptions
     with support from &rhla; will have one number to call for troubleshooting,
     fault isolation and support technical support specialists in
     &kw-hos; and &rh; technologies. If the problem is isolated to &rhla;
     software itself, the issue will be replicated on a &rh; certified
     platform and escalated to &rh; for resolution.

    <title>A Dual Support Model:</title>
    <para>
     Support technicians will troubleshoot and fault isolate an issue at the
     &productname; software level. If &kw-hos; software is excluded as the cause
     of the problem, then customers who did not purchase &rhla; support from
     &vendor; will be directed to the vendor from whom they purchased &rhla; for
     continued support.
