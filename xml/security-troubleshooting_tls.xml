  <title>Troubleshooting TLS certificate errors when running playbooks with a limit</title>
  <para>
   Has the deployer been restarted after the original site installation or is
   this a new deployer? If so, TLS certificates need to be bootstrapped before
   a playbook is run with limits. You can do this by running the following
   command.
  </para>
<screen>
cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/ardana/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts tls-reconfigure.yml --limit TLS-CA
</screen>

  <title>Certificate Update Failure</title>
  <para>
   In general, if a certificate update fails, it is because of the following:
   Haproxy has not restarted or the Trust chain is not installed. This is the
   certificate of the CA that signed the server certificate.
  </para>
 </section>
 <section>
  <title>Troubleshooting trust chain installation</title>
  <para>
   It is important to note that while &kw-hos-phrase; allows you to add new
   trust chains, it would be better if you add all the required trust chains
   during the initial deploy. Trust chain changes can impact services.
  </para>
  <para>
   However, this does not apply to certificates. There is a certificate-related
   issue whereby haproxy is not restarted if certificate content has been
   changed but the certificate file name remained the same. If you are having
   issues and you have replaced the content of existing CA file with new
   content, create another CA file with a new name. Also make sure the CA file
   has a .crt extension.
  </para>
  <para>
   Do not update both certificate and the CA together. Add the CA first and
   then run a site deploy. Then update the certificate and run tls-reconfigure,
   FND-CLU-stop, FND-CLU-start and then ardana-reconfigure. If you know which
   playbook failed, rerun it with -vv to get detaled error information. The
   configure, HAproxy restart, and reconfigure steps are included in
   <xref linkend="idg-all-security-tls-config-xml-1"/>.
  </para>
  <para>
   You can run the following commands to see if client libraries see the CA
   you have added:

  <para>
   Java client libraries are used by Monasca, so compute nodes will not have
   them. So the first three errors are expected. Check that the fingerprint is
   correct by checking the CA:
  </para>
<screen>~/scratch/d002-certs/t002$ openssl x509 -in example-CA.crt -noout -fingerprint
  SHA1 Fingerprint=E7:B2:6E:9E:00:FB:86:0F:E5:46:CD:B8:C5:67:13:53:4E:3D:8F:43</screen>
  <para>
   If they do not match, there likely was a name collision. Add the CA cert again
   with a new file name. If you get Monasca errors but find that the
   fingerprints match, try stopping and restarting Monasca.
