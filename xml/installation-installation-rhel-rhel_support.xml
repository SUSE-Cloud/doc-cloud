<para>HPE customers who have purchased both &kw-hos; and RHEL
                            subscriptions with support from HPE will have one number to call for
                            troubleshooting, fault isolation and support from HPE technical support
                            specialists in &kw-hos; and RedHat technologies. If
                            the problem is isolated to RHEL software itself the issue will be
                            replicated on a RedHat certified platform and escalated to RedHat for
                            resolution. </para>

<para>HPE will troubleshoot and fault isolate an issue at the Helion software

                            of the problem, then customers who did not purchase RHEL support from
                            HPE will be directed to the vendor from whom they purchased RHEL for
                            continued support. </para>
