 <title>Removing a Ceph RADOS Gateway Node</title>
 <para>
  Steps for removing Ceph RADOS Gateway nodes.
 </para>
 <para>
  The process to remove Ceph RADOS Gateway nodes depends on how they have been
  deployed. The Ceph Rados Gateway service can be installed in one of the
  following modes:
 </para>
 <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    On dedicated cluster nodes (default) - Removal of a RADOS Gateway node is
    only supported when it is installed on a dedicated cluster node.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    On (dedicated) cluster node(s) that host Ceph Monitor service - When
    installed in this mode, you must remove both the RADOS Gateway and Monitor
    using the procedure mentioned <xref linkend="remove_monitor_node"/>. You
    cannot remove RADOS Gateway node alone.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    On controller nodes - When installed in this mode, the removal of the RADOS
    Gateway is not supported.
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </itemizedlist>
 <note>
  <para>
   To maintain high availability for the RADOS Gateway service, you should have
   at least two RADOS Gateway nodes in your deployment.
  </para>
 </note>
<!-- Commented in DITA original: -->
<!--<section><title>Notes</title><p>It is recommended to maintain an odd
number of Ceph monitors because the Paxos protocol is being used by Ceph
monitors to form a consensus. Although clusters can be deployed with a single
monitor, we strongly recommend to deploy three monitors on independent nodes
for production usage to avoid a single point of failure of the monitor
service.</p><p>For this reason, it is recommended to maintain at least three
and an odd number of Ceph monitors.</p></section>-->

  <title>Removing the Node from Monitoring</title>
  <para>
   Once you have removed the Rados Gateway node, the alarm against them will
   trigger, which requires you to perform additional steps to resolve it.
  </para>
  <para>
   You must SSH to each of the Monasca API servers and edit the
   <literal>/etc/monasca/agent/conf.d/host_alive.yaml</literal> file to remove
   references to the Rados Gateway node that has been removed. This requires
   <literal>sudo</literal> access.
  </para>
  <para>
   After removal of the Rados Gateway references on each of your Monasca API
   servers, restart the monasca-agent on each of those servers with the
   following command:
  </para>
<screen>sudo service monasca-agent restart</screen>
  <para>
   With the Rados Gateway node references removed and the monasca-agent
   restarted, you can then delete the corresponding alarm to finish this
   process. For this purpose, you are recommend to use the Monasca CLI, which
   should be installed on each of your Monasca API servers by default:
  </para>
<screen>monasca alarm-list --metric-name host_alive_status --metric-dimensions hostname=&lt;ceph monitor node deleted&gt;</screen>

   Execute the following command to delete the alarm:
