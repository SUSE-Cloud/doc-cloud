  The user interface for monitoring your services, servers, and log data
  integrates with Grafana, an open source application for visualizing
  large-scale monitoring data. Use the options at the top border of the
  <guilabel>Overview</guilabel> page to access Grafana.

  <phrase>CMM</phrase> ships with preconfigured metrics dashboards. You can
  instantly use them for monitoring your environment. You can also use them as
  a starting point for building your own dashboards.

  As an OpenStack operator, you use the <guilabel>Dashboard</guilabel> option
  on the <guilabel>Overview</guilabel> page to view the metrics data on the
  OpenStack services. The Monitoring Service operator uses the
  <guilabel>Dashboard</guilabel> option to view the metrics data on the
  Monitoring Service.

    of total memory (<literal>mem.total_mb</literal>), used memory
    (<literal>mem.used_mb</literal>), total swap memory
    (<literal>mem.swap_total_mb</literal>), and used swap memory

  <title>Building Dashboards</title>
 <para>
  Each metrics dashboard is composed of one or more panels that are arranged in
  one or more rows. A row serves as a logical divider within a dashboard. It
  organizes your panels in groups. The panel is the basic building block for
  visualizing your metrics data.
 </para>
 <para>
  For building dashboards, you have two options:

 <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Start from scratch and create a new dashboard.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Take the dashboard that is shipped with <phrase>CMM</phrase> as a starting
    point and customize it.
   </para>
  </listitem>

 <para>
  The following sections provide introductory information on dashboards, rows,
  and panels, and make you familiar with the first steps involved in building a
  dashboard. For additional information, you can also refer to the
  <link xlink:href="http://docs.grafana.org/v1.9/">Grafana documentation</link>.

 <section xml:id="creating-dashboards">
  <title>Creating Dashboards</title>
 <para>
  To create a new dashboard, you use <guilabel>Open Dashboard</guilabel> in the
  top right corner of your dashboard window. The option provides access to
  various features for administrating dashboards. Use <guilabel>New</guilabel>
  to create an empty dashboard that serves as a starting point for adding rows
  and panels.

 <para>
  On the left side of an empty dashboard, there is a green rectangle displayed.
  Hover over this rectangle to access a <guilabel>Row</guilabel> menu. To
  insert your first panel, you can use the options in the <guilabel>Add
  Panel</guilabel> submenu. See below for details on the available panel types.
 </para>
 <para>
  As soon as you have inserted an empty panel, you can add additional rows. For
  this purpose, use the <guilabel>Add Row</guilabel> option on the right side
  of the dashboard.
 </para>
 </section>
 <section xml:id="editing-rows">
  <title>Editing Rows</title>
 <para>
  Features for editing rows can be accessed via the green rectangle that is
  displayed to the left of each row.
 </para>
 <para>
  In addition to adding panels to a row, you can collapse or remove a row, move
  the position of the row within your dashboard, or set the row height. Row
  settings allows you, for example, to insert a row title or to hide the
  <guilabel>Row</guilabel> menu so that the row can no longer be edited.

  <title>Editing Panels</title>
 <para>
  Grafana distinguishes between three panel types:

   </textobject>
  </mediaobject>
 </informalfigure>
 <para>
  Panels of type <guilabel>Graph</guilabel> are used to visualize metrics data.
  A query editor is provided to define the data to be visualized. The editor
  allows you to combine multiple queries. This means that any number of metrics
  and data series can be visualized in one panel.
 </para>
 <para>
  Panels of type <guilabel>Singlestat</guilabel> are also used to visualize
  metrics data, yet they reduce a single query to a single number. The single
  number can be, for example, the minimum, maximum, average, or sum of values
  of the data series. The single number can be translated into a text value, if
  required.
 </para>
 <para>
  Panels of type <guilabel>Text</guilabel> are used to insert static text. The
  text may, for example, provide information for the dashboard users. Text
  panels are not connected to any metrics data.
 </para>
 <para>
  As soon as you have added a panel to your dashboard, you can access the
  options for editing the panel content. For this purpose, click the panel
  title and use <guilabel>Edit</guilabel>:
 </para>
 <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    For panels of type <guilabel>Text</guilabel>, a simple text editor is
    displayed for entering text. Plain text, HTML, and markdown format are
    supported.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    For panels of type <guilabel>Graph</guilabel> and
    <guilabel>Singlestat</guilabel>, a query editor is displayed to define
    which data it to be shown. You can add multiple metrics, and apply
    functions to the metrics. The query results will be visualized in your
    panel in real time.
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </itemizedlist>
 <para>
  A large number of display and formatting features are provided to customize
  how the content is presented in a panel. Click the panel title to access the
  corresponding options. The menu that is displayed also allows you to
  duplicate or remove a panel. To change the size of a panel, click the
  <guilabel>+</guilabel> and <guilabel>-</guilabel> icons.
 </para>
 <para>
  You can move panels on your dashboard by simply dragging and dropping them
  within and between rows.
 </para>
 <para>
  By default, the time range for panels is controlled by dashboard settings.
  Use the time picker in the top right corner of your dashboard window to
  define relative or absolute time ranges. You can also set an auto-refresh
  interval, or manually refresh the data that is displayed.
 </para>
 </section>
 <section xml:id="saving-sharing-dashboards">
  <title>Saving and Sharing Dashboards</title>
 <para>
  <phrase>CMM</phrase> allows you to save your metrics dashboards locally.
  Saving a dashboard means exporting it to a JSON file. The JSON file can be
  edited, it can be shared with other users, and it can be imported to
  <phrase>CMM</phrase> again.
 </para>
 <para>
  To save a dashboard, use <guilabel>Save</guilabel> in the top right corner of
  your dashboard window. The option allows you to directly view the JSON syntax
  and export the dashboard to a JSON file. The JSON file can be forwarded to
  other users, if required. To import a JSON file, use <guilabel>Open
  dashboard</guilabel> in the top left corner of the dashboard window.
