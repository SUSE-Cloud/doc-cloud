 <title>Status of Services, Servers, and Log Data</title>
 <para>
  An alarm definition for a service, server, or log data is evaluated over the
  interval specified in the alarm expression. The alarm definition is
  re-evaluated in each subsequent interval. The following alarm statuses are
  distinguished:
 </para>
 <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    <literal>Alarm</literal>. The alarm expression has evaluated to
    <literal>true</literal>. An alarm has been triggered for the cloud
    resource.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    <literal>OK</literal>. The alarm expression has evaluated to
    <literal>false</literal>. There is no need to trigger an alarm.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    <literal>Undetermined</literal>. No metrics data has been received within
    the defined interval.
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </itemizedlist>
 <para>
  As soon as you have defined an alarm for a cloud resource, there is status
  information displayed for it on the <guilabel>Overview</guilabel> page:
 </para>
 <para>
  The color of the boxes in the three sections indicates the status:
 </para>
 <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    A green box for a service or server indicates that it is up and running. A
    green box for a log path indicates that a defined threshold for errors or
    warnings, for example, has not yet been reached or exceeded. There are
    alarms defined for the services, servers, or log paths, but no alarms have
    been triggered.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    A red box for a service, server, or log path indicates that there is a
    severe problem that needs to be checked. One or multiple alarms defined for
    a service, a server, or log data have been triggered.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    A yellow box indicates a problem. One or multiple alarms have already been
    triggered, yet, the severity of these alarms is low.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    A gray box indicates that alarms have been defined. Yet, metrics data has
    not been received.
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </itemizedlist>
 <para>
  The status information on the <guilabel>Overview</guilabel> page results from
  one or multiple alarms that have been defined for the corresponding resource.
  If multiple alarms are defined, the severity of the individual alarms
  controls the status color.
 </para>
 <para>
  You can click a resource on the <guilabel>Overview</guilabel> page to display
  details on the related alarms. The details include the status of each alarm
  and the expression that is evaluated. For each alarm, you can drill down on
  the alarm history. To narrow down the problem, the history presents detailed
  information on the status transitions.
