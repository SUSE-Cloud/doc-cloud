  The monitoring solution of <phrase>SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</phrase>
  addresses the requirements of large-scale public and private clouds where
  high numbers of physical and virtual servers need to be monitored and huge
  amounts of monitoring data need to be managed. <phrase>SUSE OpenStack Cloud
  Monitoring</phrase> consolidates metrics, alarms, and notifications, as well
  as health and status information from multiple systems, thus reducing the
  complexity and allowing for a higher level analysis of the monitoring data.

 <para>
  The <emphasis role="bold">Monitoring Service operator</emphasis> is
  responsible for providing the monitoring features to the application
  operators and the OpenStack operator. This enables the application operators
  and the OpenStack operator to focus on operation and ensure the quality of
  their services without having to carry out the tedious tasks implied by
  setting up and administrating their own system monitoring software. The
  Monitoring Service operator uses the features for monitoring the
  operation of <phrase>SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</phrase>.
 </para>
 <para>
  As the Monitoring Service operator, you have the following responsibilities:

  <title>Metrics</title>
  <para>
   A Metrics Agent can be installed and configured on each physical and virtual
   server where cloud resources are to be monitored. The agent is responsible
   for querying metrics and sending the data to the Monitoring Service for
   further processing.
  </para>
  <para>
   Metrics are self-describing data structures that are uniquely identified by a
   name and a set of dimensions. Each dimension consists of a key/value pair
   that allows for a flexible and concise description of the data to be
   monitored, for example, region, availability zone, service tier, or resource
   ID.
  </para>
  <para>
   The Metrics Agent supports various types of metrics including the following:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     System metrics, for example, CPU usage, consumed disk space, or network
     traffic.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Host alive checks. The agent can perform active checks on a host to
     determine whether it is alive using ping (ICMP) or SSH.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Process checks. The agent can check and monitor a process, for example, the
     number of instances, memory size, or number of threads.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     HTTP endpoint checks. The agent can perform up/down checks on HTTP
     endpoints by sending an HTTP request and reporting success or failure to
     the Monitoring Service.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Service checks. The agent can check middleware services, for example,
     MySQL, Kafka, or RabbitMQ.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     OpenStack services. The agent can perform specific checks on each process
     that is part of an OpenStack service.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Log metrics. The agent can check and monitor the number of critical log
     entries in the log data retrieved from the cloud resources.

   <title>Alarms and Notifications</title>
   <para>
    <phrase>SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</phrase> supports GUI-based alarm and
    notification management. <phrase>Template-based alarm definitions allow for
    monitoring a dynamically changing set of resources without the need for
    reconfiguration. While the number of underlying virtual machines is changing,
    for example, this ensures the efficient monitoring of scalable cloud
    services. Alarm definitions allow you to specify expressions that are
    evaluated based on the metrics data that is received. Alarm definitions can
    be combined to form compound alarms. Compound alarms allow you to track and
    process even more complex events. Notifications can be configured in order to
    inform <phrase>SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</phrase> users when an alarm
    is triggered.</phrase>
