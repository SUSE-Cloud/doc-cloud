 <title>DNS Service Installation Overview</title>
 <para>
  The &kw-hos; DNS Service supports several different backends for domain name
  service. The choice of backend must be included in the deployment model
  before the &kw-hos; install is completed.
 </para>
 <warning>
  <para>
   By default any user in the project is allowed to manage a DNS domain. This
   can be changed by updating the Policy.json file for Designate.
  </para>
 </warning>
 <para>
  The backends that are available within the DNS Service are separated into two
  categories, self-contained and external.
