 <title>Upgrade Tempest as Service</title>
 <para>
  In &kw-hos-phrase;, Tempest has been modelled as a service and this gives you
  the ability to locate Tempest anywhere in the cloud. It is recommended that
  you install Tempest on your lifecycle manager node as that is where it
  resides by default in a new installation.
 </para>
 <para>
  When you are upgrading from &kw-hos-phrase; 3.0, you must add
  <literal>tempest</literal> as a service in you cloud definition after the
  upgrade completes. Typically, you will add an entry in the file
  <literal>~/helion/my_cloud/definition/data/control_plane.yml</literal>:
