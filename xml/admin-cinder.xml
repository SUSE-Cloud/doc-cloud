  <title>Cinder Administration Guide</title>
  <para>The OpenStack Block Storage service works through the interaction of
            a series of daemon processes named <literal>cinder-*</literal> that reside
            persistently on the host machine or machines. You can run all the
            binaries from a single node, or spread across multiple nodes. You can
            also run them on the same node as other OpenStack services.</para>
  <para>To administer the OpenStack Block Storage service, it is helpful to
            understand a number of concepts. You must make certain choices when
            you configure the Block Storage service in OpenStack. The bulk of the
            options come down to two choices - single node or multi-node install.
            You can read a longer discussion about <link xlink:href="https://docs.openstack.org/operations-guide/ops-user-facing-operations.html#block-storage">Block Storage</link> in the

  <para>OpenStack Block Storage enables you to add extra block-level storage
            to your OpenStack Compute instances. This service is similar to the
            Amazon EC2 Elastic Block Storage (EBS) offering.</para>
