 <title>Running the Swift Dispersion Report</title>
 <para>
  Swift contains a tool called <literal>swift-dispersion-report</literal> that
  can be used to determine whether your containers and objects have three
  replicas like they are supposed to. This tool works by populating a
  percentage of partitions in the system with containers and objects (using
  <literal>swift-dispersion-populate</literal>) and then running the report to
  see if all the replicas of these containers and objects are in the correct
  place. For a more detailed explanation of this tool in Openstack Swift,
  please see
  <link xlink:href="http://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/admin_guide.html#cluster-health">OpenStack
  Swift - Administrator's Guide</link>.

  <title>Configuring the Swift dispersion populate</title>
  <para>
   Once a Swift system has been fully deployed in &product;, you can
   setup the swift-dispersion-report using the default parameters found in
   <filename>~/openstack/ardana/ansible/roles/swift-dispersion/templates/dispersion.conf.j2</filename>.
   This populates 1% of the partitions on the system and if you are happy with
   this figure, please proceed to step 2 below. Otherwise, follow step 1 to
   edit the configuration file.

     If you wish to change the dispersion coverage percentage, then connect
     to the &clm; server and change the value of
     <literal>dispersion_coverage</literal> in the
     <filename>~/openstack/ardana/ansible/roles/swift-dispersion/templates/dispersion.conf.j2</filename>
     file to the value you wish to use. In the example below we have altered
     the file to create 5% dispersion:

[dispersion]
auth_url = {{ keystone_identity_uri }}/v3
auth_user = {{ swift_dispersion_tenant }}:{{ swift_dispersion_user }}
auth_key = {{ swift_dispersion_password  }}
endpoint_type = {{ endpoint_type }}
auth_version = {{ disp_auth_version }}
# Set this to the percentage coverage. We recommend a value
# of 1%. You can increase this to get more coverage. However, if you
# decrease the value, the dispersion containers and objects are
# not deleted.

  <title>Running the Swift dispersion report</title>
  <para>
   Check the status of the Swift system by running the Swift dispersion report
   with this playbook:
  </para>
<screen>&prompt.ardana;cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/ardana/ansible
&prompt.ardana;ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts swift-dispersion-report.yml</screen>
  <para>
   The output of the report will look similar to this:
  </para>

   In addition to being able to run the report above, there will be a cron-job
   scheduled to run every 2 hours located on the primary proxy node of your
   cloud environment. It will run <literal>dispersion-report</literal> and save
   the results to the following location on its local filesystem:

<screen>/var/cache/swift/dispersion-report</screen>
