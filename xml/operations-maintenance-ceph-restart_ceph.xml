 <title>Recovering Ceph Hosts After a Reboot</title>
 <para>
  Steps for recovering Ceph hosts after a reboot. If you have one or more Ceph
  hosts that have been rebooted, these steps will assist you in the recovery.
 </para>
 <orderedlist>

   <para>
    Reboot the Ceph monitor node.

   <para>
    From the &lcm;, once the rebooted Ceph monitor node has
    succesfully booted, wait approximately one minute and then execute the
    following playbook:
   </para>
<screen>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts ceph-status.yml --limit &lt;monitor-hostname&gt;</screen>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    If the playbook executes successfully, repeat the steps above for each
    Ceph monitor node that was rebooted.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Once all the Ceph monitor nodes have been rebooted and are confirmed to be
    up then execute the command below on each monitor node:
   </para>
<screen>ceph quorum_status</screen>
   <para>
    Ensure that all of the monitor nodes have joined the quorum by checking
    that the <literal>quorum_names</literal> section in the output from the
    above command lists all of the monitors in the Ceph cluster.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Next, reboot the OSD node in the cluster.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Once the OSD node comes up, wait approximately five minutes and then
    execute the following playbook from the &lcm;:
   </para>
<screen>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts ceph-status.yml --limit &lt;OSD-hostname&gt;</screen>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    If the playbook executes successfully, repeat steps 5-6 for each OSD node
    in the cluster.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Once the entire cluster has been rebooted, check the health of the Ceph
    cluster by executing the below command from any OSD node, and ensuring
    that output is <literal>HEALTH_OK</literal>:
   </para>
<screen>ceph health</screen>
  </listitem>
<!-- Comment from DITA original: -->
<!-- The previously listed command 'ceph health details' produces a usage
error regarding 'Invalid Command: unused arguments: details'. The command
'ceph health' provides the 'HEALTH_OK' response -->
