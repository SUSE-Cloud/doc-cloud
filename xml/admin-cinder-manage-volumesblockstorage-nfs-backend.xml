  <title>Configure an NFS storage back-end</title>
  <para>This section explains how to configure OpenStack Block Storage to use
            NFS storage. You must be able to access the NFS shares from the server
            that hosts the <literal>cinder</literal> volume service.</para>
  <note>
    <para>The <literal>cinder</literal> volume service is named <literal>openstack-cinder-volume</literal>.</para>

  <procedure>
    <step>
      <para>Log in as <literal>root</literal> to the system hosting the <literal>cinder</literal> volume
                    service.</para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>Create a text file named <literal>nfsshares</literal> in the <literal>/etc/cinder/</literal> directory.</para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>Add an entry to <literal>/etc/cinder/nfsshares</literal> for each NFS share
                    that the <literal>cinder</literal> volume service should use for back-end storage.
                    Each entry should be a separate line, and should use the following
                    format:</para>
      <screen language="bash">HOST:SHARE</screen>
      <para>Where:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>HOST is the IP address or host name of the NFS server.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>SHARE is the absolute path to an existing and accessible NFS share.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>Set <literal>/etc/cinder/nfsshares</literal> to be owned by the <literal>root</literal> user and
                    the <literal>cinder</literal> group:</para>
      <screen language="console"># chown root:cinder /etc/cinder/nfsshares</screen>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>Set <literal>/etc/cinder/nfsshares</literal> to be readable by members of the
                    cinder group:</para>
      <screen language="console"># chmod 0640 /etc/cinder/nfsshares</screen>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>Configure the <literal>cinder</literal> volume service to use the
                    <literal>/etc/cinder/nfsshares</literal> file created earlier. To do so, open
                    the <literal>/etc/cinder/cinder.conf</literal> configuration file and set
                    the <literal>nfs_shares_config</literal> configuration key
                    to <literal>/etc/cinder/nfsshares</literal>.</para>
      <para>On distributions that include <literal>openstack-config</literal>, you can configure
                    this by running the following command instead:</para>
      <screen language="console"># openstack-config --set /etc/cinder/cinder.conf \
  DEFAULT nfs_shares_config /etc/cinder/nfsshares</screen>
      <para>SUSE Linux Enterprise includes openstack-config.</para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>Optionally, provide any additional NFS mount options required in
                    your environment in the <literal>nfs_mount_options</literal> configuration key
                    of <literal>/etc/cinder/cinder.conf</literal>. If your NFS shares do not
                    require any additional mount options (or if you are unsure),
                    skip this step.</para>
      <para>As SUSE Linux Enterprise includes <literal>openstack-config</literal>, you can
                    configure this by running the following command instead:</para>
      <screen language="console"># openstack-config --set /etc/cinder/cinder.conf \
  DEFAULT nfs_mount_options OPTIONS</screen>
      <para>Replace OPTIONS with the mount options to be used when accessing
                    NFS shares. See the manual page for NFS for more information on
                    available mount options (<command>man nfs</command>).</para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>Configure the <literal>cinder</literal> volume service to use the correct volume
                    driver, namely <literal>cinder.volume.drivers.nfs.NfsDriver</literal>. To do so,
                    open the <literal>/etc/cinder/cinder.conf</literal> configuration file and
                    set the volume_driver configuration key
                    to <literal>cinder.volume.drivers.nfs.NfsDriver</literal>.</para>
      <para>On distributions that include <literal>openstack-config</literal>, you can configure
                    this by running the following command instead:</para>
      <screen language="console"># openstack-config --set /etc/cinder/cinder.conf \
  DEFAULT volume_driver cinder.volume.drivers.nfs.NfsDriver</screen>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>You can now restart the service to apply the configuration.</para>
      <note>
        <para>The <literal>nfs_sparsed_volumes</literal> configuration key determines whether
                        volumes are created as sparse files and grown as needed or fully
                        allocated up front. The default and recommended value is <literal>true</literal>,
                        which ensures volumes are initially created as sparse files.</para>
        <para>Setting <literal>nfs_sparsed_volumes</literal> to <literal>false</literal> will result in
                        volumes being fully allocated at the time of creation. This leads
                        to increased delays in volume creation.</para>
        <para>However, should you choose to set <literal>nfs_sparsed_volumes</literal> to
                        <literal>false</literal>, you can do so directly in <literal>/etc/cinder/cinder.conf</literal>.</para>
        <para>As SUSE Linux Enterprise includes <literal>openstack-config</literal>, you can
                        configure this by running the following command instead:</para>
        <screen language="console"># openstack-config --set /etc/cinder/cinder.conf \
  DEFAULT nfs_sparsed_volumes false</screen>
      </note>
      <warning>
        <para>If a client host has SELinux enabled, the <literal>virt_use_nfs</literal>
                        boolean should also be enabled if the host requires access to
                        NFS volumes on an instance. To enable this boolean, run the
                        following command as the <literal>root</literal> user:</para>
        <screen language="console"># setsebool -P virt_use_nfs on</screen>
        <para>This command also makes the boolean persistent across reboots.
                        Run this command on all client hosts that require access to NFS
                        volumes on an instance. This includes all compute nodes.</para>
