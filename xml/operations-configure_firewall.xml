 <title>Configuring the &kw-hos; Firewall</title>
 <para>
  The following instructions provide information about how to identify and
  modify the overall &kw-hos; firewall that is configured in front of the
  control services. This firewall is administered only by a cloud admin and is
  not available for tenant use for private network firewall services.
 </para>
 <para>
  During the installation process, the configuration processor will
  automatically generate "allow" firewall rules for each server based on the
  services deployed and block all other ports. These are populated in
  <literal>~/openstack/my_cloud/info/firewall_info.yml</literal>, which includes
  a list of all the ports by network, including the addresses on which the
  ports will be opened. This is described in more detail in
  <xref linkend="concept_firewallconfiguration"/>.
 </para>
 <para>
  The <literal>firewall_rules.yml</literal> file in the input model allows you
  to define additional rules for each network group. You can read more about
  this in <xref linkend="configobj_firewallrules"/>.
 </para>
 <para>
  The purpose of this document is to show you how to make post-installation
  changes to the firewall rules if the need arises.
 </para>
 <important>
  <para>
   This process is not to be confused with Firewall-as-a-Service (see
   <xref linkend="HP2.0FWaaS"/>),
   which is a separate service that enables the ability for &kw-hos; tenants
   to create north-south, network-level firewalls to provide stateful
   protection to all instances in a private, tenant network. This service is
   optional and is tenant-configured.

     Edit your
     <literal>~/openstack/my_cloud/definition/data/firewall_rules.yml</literal>
     file and add the lines necessary to allow the port(s) needed through the
     firewall.

    <para>
     In this example we are going to open up port range 5900-5905 to allow VNC
     traffic through the firewall:
    </para>
<screen>
  - name: VNC
    network-groups:
  - MANAGEMENT
    rules:
     - type: allow
       remote-ip-prefix:  0.0.0.0/0
       port-range-min: 5900
       port-range-max: 5905
       protocol: tcp</screen>
    <note>
     <para>
      The example above shows a <literal>remote-ip-prefix</literal> of
      <literal>0.0.0.0/0</literal> which opens the ports up to all IP ranges.
      To be more secure you can specify your local IP address CIDR you will
      be running the VNC connect from.
