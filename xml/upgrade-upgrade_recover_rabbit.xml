  <title>Recovering RabbitMQ after Failure during Upgrade</title>
  <para>
   During upgrade, RabbitMQ can lockup at cluster synchronization. If you
   encounter an error similar to the following during upgrade, you should run
   the RabbitMQ disaster recovery playbook and start the upgrade again.

     This will tear down and reset any running RabbitMQ nodes. This has an
     extreme effect on services. This should take roughly two minutes to
     complete, at which point the RabbitMQ cluster will have been recreated
     from scratch with service credentials reprovisioned into it.
