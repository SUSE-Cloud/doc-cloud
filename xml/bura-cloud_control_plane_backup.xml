 <title>Enabling Default Backups of the Control Plane to an SSH Target</title>
 <para>
  This topic describes how you can set up an external server as a backup server
  in case you lose access to your cloud servers that store the default backups.
 </para>
 <section>
  <title>Default Backup and Restore</title>
  <para>
   As part of the installation procedure in &productname;, automatic
   backup/restore jobs are set up to back up to Swift via the Freezer scheduler
   component of the backup and restore service. The backup jobs perform
   scheduled backups of &productname; control plane data
   (files/directories/db). The restore jobs can be used to restore appropriate
   control plane data. Additional automatic jobs can be added to backup/restore
   from the secure shell (SSH) server that you set up/designate. It is
   recommended that you set up SSH backups so that in the event that you lose
   all of your control plane nodes at once, you have a backup on remote servers
   that you can use to restore the control plane nodes. Note that you do not
   have to restore from the SSH location if only one or two control plane nodes
   are lost. In that case, they can be recovered from the data on the remaining
   control plane node following the restore procedures in
   <xref linkend="recovering_controller_nodes"/>. That document also explains
   how to recover using your remote server SSH backups.
  </para>
  <para>
   While control plane backups to Swift are set up automatically, you must use
   the following procedure to set up SSH backups.
  </para>

  <title>Setting up SSH backups</title>
  <para>
   By default, during &product; deployment, backup jobs are automatically
   deployed to Swift, the MySQL database, the &lcm;, and Swift
   rings. Restore jobs are also deployed for convenience. It is more secure to
   store those backups also outside of the &productname; infrastructure. If you
   provide all the values required in the following file, jobs will also be
   deployed to backup and restore to/from an SSH server of your choice:

   </listitem>
