       This metric is the number of bytes read from objects in GET requests
       processed by this host during the last minute. Only successful GET
       requests to objects are counted. GET requests to the account or
       container is not included.

      <para>
       This metric reports the total length of all async pending queues in the
       system.
      </para>
      <para>
       When a container update fails, the update is placed on the async pending
       queue. An update may fail becuase the container server is too busy or
       because the server is down or failed. Later the system will “replay”
       updates from the queue – so eventually, the container listings will
       show all objects known to the system.
      </para>
      <para>
       If you know that container servers are down, it is normal to see the
       value of async pending increase. Once the server is restored, the value
       should return to zero.
      </para>
      <para>
       A non-zero value may also indicate that containers are too large. Look
       for “lock timeout” messages in /var/log/swift/swift.log. If you find
       such messages consider reducing the container size or enable rate
       limiting.

       The total exception string is truncated if longer than 1919 characters
       and an ellipsis is prepended in the first three characters of the
       message. If there is more than one error reported, the list of errors is
       paired to the last reported error and the operator is expected to
       resolve failures until no more are reported. Where there are no further
       reported errors, the Value Class is emitted as ‘Ok’.

       Is the highest utilization of all drives in the system. The value is a
       percentage (example: 80.0 means at least one drive is 80% utilized). The
       value is just as important as swiftlm.diskusage.usage.avg. For example,
       if swiftlm.diskusage.usage.avg is 70% you might think that there is
       plenty of space available. However, if swiftlm.diskusage.usage.max is
       100%, this means that some objects cannot be stored on that drive. Swift
       will store replicas on other drives. However, this will create extra
       overhead.

       This is the number of seconds since the account replicator last

       Normally the replicators runs periodically and hence this value will
       decrease whenever a replicator completes. However, if a replicator is
       not completing a cycle, this value increases (by one second for each
       second that the replicator is not completing). If the value remains high
       and increasing for a long period of time, it indicates that one of the

       If an unrecoverable read error (URE) occurs on a filesystem, the error

       UREs are common on large disk drives. They do not necessarily indicate

       to repair the filesystem. Failing this, you may need to wipe the
       filesystem.

       If UREs occur very often on a specific drive, this may indicate that the

       This reports how long (in seconds) since the replicator process last
       finished a replication run. If the replicator is stuck, the time will
       keep increasing forever. The time a replicator normally takes depends on
       disk sizes and how much data needs to be replicated. However, a value
       over 24 hours is generally bad.

       This reports how long (in seconds) since the replicator process last
       finished a replication run. If the replicator is stuck, the time will
       keep increasing forever. The time a replicator normally takes depends on
       disk sizes and how much data needs to be replicated. However, a value
       over 24 hours is generally bad.

       This metric reports the state of each component after N-iterations of
       checks. If the initial check succeeds, the checks move onto the next
       component until all components are queried, then the checks sleep for
       ‘main_loop_interval’ seconds. If a check fails, it is retried every
       second for ‘retries’ number of times per component. If the check
       fails ‘retries’ times, it is reported as a fail instance.

       This metric reports the average of all the collected records in the
       swiftlm.umon.target.val.avail_minute metric data. This is a walking
       average data set of these approximately per-minute states of the Swift
       Object Store. The most basic case is a whole day of successful
       per-minute records, which will average to 100% availability. If there is
       any downtime throughout the day resulting in gaps of data which are two
       minutes or longer, the per-minute availability data will be “back
       filled” with an assumption of a down state for all the per-minute
       records which did not exist during the non-reported time. Because this
       is a walking average of approximately 24 hours worth of data, any
       outtage will take 24 hours to be purged from the dataset.
