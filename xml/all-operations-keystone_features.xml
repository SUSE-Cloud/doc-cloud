<para><emphasis role="bold">Implied rules</emphasis></para>
<para>To allow for the practice of hierarchical permissions in user roles, this feature
                enables roles to be linked in such a way that they function as a hierarchy with role
                inheritance. </para>
<para>When a user is assigned a superior role, the user will also be assigned all roles
                implied by any subordinate roles. The hierarchy of the assigned roles will be
                expanded when issuing the user a token.</para>
<para><emphasis role="bold">Domain-specific roles</emphasis></para>
<para>This feature extends the principle of <emphasis role="bold">implied roles</emphasis> to include a set of roles
                that are specific to a domain. At the time a token is issued, the domain-specific
                roles are not included in the token, however, the roles that they map to are.</para>

<para>This feature allows identity backends to be configured on a domain-by-domain basis.
                Domains will be capable of having their own exclusive LDAP service (or multiple
                services). A single LDAP service can also serve multiple domains, with each domain
                in a separate subtree.</para>
