  <para>
   To allow for the practice of hierarchical permissions in user roles, this
   feature enables roles to be linked in such a way that they function as a
   hierarchy with role inheritance.
  </para>
  <para>
   When a user is assigned a superior role, the user will also be assigned all
   roles implied by any subordinate roles. The hierarchy of the assigned roles
   will be expanded when issuing the user a token.

  <para>
   <emphasis role="bold">Domain-specific roles</emphasis>
  </para>
  <para>
   This feature extends the principle of <emphasis role="bold">implied
   roles</emphasis> to include a set of roles that are specific to a domain. At
   the time a token is issued, the domain-specific roles are not included in
   the token, however, the roles that they map to are.

   <emphasis role="bold">Multiple LDAP backends for each domain</emphasis>
  </para>
  <para>
   This feature allows identity backends to be configured on a domain-by-domain
   basis. Domains will be capable of having their own exclusive LDAP service
   (or multiple services). A single LDAP service can also serve multiple
   domains, with each domain in a separate subtree.
  </para>
  <para>
   To implement this feature, individual domains will require domain-specific
   configuration files. Domains that do not implement this feature will
   continue to share a common backend driver.

   <emphasis role="bold">WebSSO</emphasis>
  </para>
  <para>
   This feature enables the Keystone service to provide federated identity
   services through a token-based single sign-on page. This feature is disabled
   by default, as it requires explicit configuration.

  <para>
   <emphasis role="bold">Keystone-to-keystone (K2K) federation</emphasis>
  </para>
  <para>
   This feature enables separate Keystone instances to federate identities
   among the instances, offering inter-cloud authorization. This feature is
   disabled by default, as it requires explicit configuration.
  </para>
  <para>
   <emphasis role="bold">Fernet token provider</emphasis>

  <para>
   Provides tokens in the fernet format. This is an experimental feature and is
   disabled by default.
  </para>
  <para>
   <emphasis role="bold">Domain-specific config in SQL</emphasis>
  </para>
  <para>
   Using the new REST APIs, domain-specific configuration options can be stored
   in a SQL database instead of in configuration files.

        This extension was implemented by HP to facilitate service activation.

        is only half effective right now.
