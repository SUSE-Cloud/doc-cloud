  <title>Customizing the Input Model</title>




  <para>This section covers additional changes that you can make to further adapt the example to
    your environment:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>Update <literal>disks_controller.yml</literal> to add additional disk capacity to your
        controllers.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Update <literal>disks_vsa.yml</literal> to add additional disk capacity to your VSA
        servers.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Update <literal>disks_compute.yml</literal> to add additional disk capacity to your
        compute servers.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <section xml:id="disks_controller">
    <title>disks_controller.yml</title>
    <para>The disk configuration of the controllers consists of two sections: a definition of a
      volume group that provides a number of file-systems for various subsystems, and device-group
      that provides disk capacity for Swift.</para>
  </section>


  <section xml:id="filesystems">
    <title>File Systems Storage</title>
    <para>The root volume group (hlm-vg) is divided into a number of logical volumes that provide
      separate file systems for the various services that are co-hosted on the controllers in the
      entry-scale examples. The capacity of each file system is expressed as a percentage of the
      overall volume group capacity. Because not all file system usage scales linearly, two
      different disk configurations are provided:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">CONTROLLER-DISKS</emphasis> - Based on a 512 GB root volume
          group.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">CONTROLLER-1TB-DISKS</emphasis> - Provides a higher percentage
          of space for the logging service.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>As supplied, the example uses the smaller disk model. To use the larger disk model you
      need to modify the <literal>disk-models</literal> parameter in the
        <literal>server_roles.yml</literal> file, as shown below:</para>
    <screen>
    server-roles:
        
       - name: CONTROLLER-ROLE
         interface-model: CONTROLLER-INTERFACES
         disk-model: CONTROLLER-1TB-DISKS</screen>
    <para>To add additional disks to the root volume group, you need to modify the volume group
      definition in whichever disk model you are using. The following example shows adding an
      additional disk, <literal>/dev/sdd</literal> to the <literal>disks_controller.yml</literal>
      file:</para>
    <screen>
   disk-models:
      - name: CONTROLLER-DISKS
        
        volume-groups:
         - name: hlm-vg
           physical-volumes:
        
              # NOTE: 'sda_root' is a templated value. This value is checked in
              # os-config and replaced by the partition actually used on sda
              #e.g. sda1 or sda5
              - /dev/sda_root
              <emphasis role="bold">- /dev/sdd</emphasis></screen>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="swiftstorage">
    <title>Swift Storage</title>

    <para>Swift storage is configured as a device-group and has a syntax that allows disks to be
      allocated to specific rings. In the example, two disks are allocated to Swift to be shared by
      the account, container, and object-0 rings.</para>
    <screen>
   device-groups:
       - name: swiftobj
         devices:
            - name: /dev/sdb
            - name: /dev/sdc
            # Add any additional disks for swift here
            # -name: /dev/sdd
            # -name: /dev/sde
         consumer:
           name: swift
           attrs:
              rings:
                 - account
                 - container
                 - object-0</screen>
    <para>For instruction to configure additional Swift storage, see <xref
        linkend="allocating-disk-drives"/>.</para>
  </section>


  <section xml:id="disks_vsa">
    <title>disks_vsa.yml</title>
    <para>VSA storage is configured as a device-group and has a syntax that allows disks to be
      allocated for data storage or for adaptive optimization (caching). As a best practice, you
      should use solid state drives for adaptive optimization. The example disk configuration for
      VSA nodes has two disks, one for data and one of adaptive optimization. (For more information,
      see <xref linkend="configure_vsa_ao/deploy-vsa-with-ao-without-ao"/>.)</para>
    <screen>
   device-groups:
       - name: vsa-data
         consumer:
           name: vsa
           usage: data
         devices:
           - name: /dev/sdc
       - name: vsa-cache
         consumer:
           name: vsa
           usage: adaptive-optimization
         devices:
            - name: /dev/sdb</screen>
    <para>Additional capacity can be added by adding more disks to the <literal>vsa-data</literal>
      device group. Similarly, caching capacity can be increased by adding more high speed storage
      devices to the <literal>vsa-cache</literal> device group.</para>
  </section>


  <section xml:id="disks_compute">
    <title>disks_compute.yml</title>
    <para>The example disk configuration for compute nodes consists of two volume groups: one for
      the operating system and one for the ephemeral storage for virtual machines, with one disk
      allocated to each.</para>
    <para>Additional virtual machine ephemeral storage capacity can be configured by adding
      additional disks to the <literal>vg-comp</literal> volume group. The following example shows
      the addition of two more disks, <literal>/dev/sdc</literal> and <literal>/dev/sdd</literal>,
      to the <literal>disks_compute.yml</literal> file:</para>
    <screen>
   - name: vg-comp
        physical-volumes:
          - /dev/sdb
          - /dev/sdc
          - /dev/sdd
        logical-volumes:
          - name: compute
            size: 95%
            mount: /var/lib/nova
            fstype: ext4
                  mkfs-opts: -O large_file</screen>
