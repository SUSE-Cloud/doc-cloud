  <title>Images Created in horizon UI Get Stuck in a Queued State</title>
  <para>

   <literal>Image Location</literal> which allows you to enter a HTTP source to
   use when creating a new image for your cloud. However, this option is
   disabled by default for security reasons. This results in any new images
   created via this method getting stuck in a <literal>Queued</literal> state.

   sources and the traffic goes over HTTP (non-SSL) traffic.
