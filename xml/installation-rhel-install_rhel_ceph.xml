 <title>Using &rhla; as a Ceph Client</title>
 <para>
  &kw-hos-phrase; supports &rhla; compute nodes as Ceph storage clients.
  However, the RPM packages necessary for this functionality are only
  available directly from &rh;, and are not provided with &kw-hos;. As a
  result, your &rhla; subscription should be used to obtain the needed
  RPM packages to enable Ceph storage client behavior.
 </para>
 <para>
  If you are still preparing your environment for a new installation (using
  site.yml) or upgrade (using ardana-upgrade-from-legacy.yml), the below
  steps should be done at this time, before proceeding, to enable the desired
  functionality immediately upon completing the installation.

  <title>Apply Ceph Client Packages to &rhla; &compnode;s</title>
  <para>
   Now that the Ceph storage client RPMs have been made available from your
   deployer as a repository for RHEL compute nodes, you may continue with
   your normal installation or upgrade steps.
  </para>
  <para>
   If you are enabling Ceph storage clients on an existing &kw-hos; cloud
   (not actively being installed or upgraded), execute these additional commands
   to apply the new packages to your RHEL compute nodes:
  </para>
<screen>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/ardana/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts osconfig-run.yml
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts ceph-client-prepare.yml</screen>
  <para>
   Once these steps are complete, you can proceed to use Ceph storage
   functionality on RHEL compute nodes, or provision new RHEL compute nodes with
   this capability enabled.
