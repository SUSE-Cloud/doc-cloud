 <title>Uploading an Image for Use</title>
    
    <para>To create a Compute instance, you need to obtain an image that you can use. The &kw-hos; lifecycle manager provides an Ansible playbook that will download a
        CirrOS Linux image, and then upload it as a public image to your image repository for use
        across your projects.</para>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect4">Running the Playbook</bridgehead><para>Use the following command to run this playbook:</para>
<screen>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts glance-cloud-configure.yml -e proxy=&lt;PROXY&gt;</screen><para>The table below shows the optional switch that you can use as part of this playbook to
        specify environment-specific information:</para>

        will be compatible with your cloud:</para>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect4">Using the GlanceClient CLI to Create Images</bridgehead><para>You can use the GlanceClient on a machine accessible to your cloud or it's also installed
        automatically on your lifecycle manager.</para>
<para>The GlanceClient allows you to create, update, list, and delete images as well as manage
        your image member lists, which allows you to share access to images across multiple tenants.
        As with most of the OpenStack CLI tools, you can use the <literal>glance help</literal>
        command to get a full list of commands as well as their syntax.</para>
<para>If you would like to use the <literal>--copy-from</literal> option when creating an image,
        you will need to have your Administrator enable the http store in your environment using the
        instructions outlined at <xref linkend="configure_glance"/>.</para>
