  <title>Using the GlanceClient CLI to Create Images</title>
  <para>
   You can use the GlanceClient on a machine accessible to your cloud or on
   your &clm; where it is automatically installed.
  </para>
  <para>
   The GlanceClient allows you to create, update, list, and delete images as
   well as manage your image member lists, which allows you to share access to
   images across multiple tenants. As with most of the OpenStack CLI tools, you
   can use the <literal>glance help</literal> command to get a full list of
   commands as well as their syntax.
  </para>
  <para>
   If you would like to use the <literal>--copy-from</literal> option when
   creating an image, you will need to have your Administrator enable the http
   store in your environment using the instructions outlined at
   <xref linkend="copyfrom"/>.
