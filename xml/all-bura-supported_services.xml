        <para>By default, the following are <emphasis role="bold">automatically</emphasis> backed
                up. You do not have to do anything for these backup jobs to run. However if you want
                to back up to somewhere outside the cluster, you do need to <xref

                        <para>MySQL database. In the MySQL database is most of the data you need to
                                restore services. ESX and Ceph data recovery is not complete, but
                                for other services you will have the data you need to recover.
                                Logging data in elastic search is not backed up. Swift objects are
                                not backed up because of the redundant nature of Swift.</para>

                        <para>Swift rings. Swift rings are backed up so that you can recover more
                                quickly even though Swift can rebuild the rings without this data.
                                However automatically rebuilding the rings is slower than restoring
                                via a backup.</para>

        <para>The following services will be effectively backed up. In other words, the data needed
                to restore the services is backed up. The critical data that will be backed up are
                the databases and the configuration-related files. Note the data that is not backed
                up per service:</para>

                                Swift will rebuild the rings itself, restoring from backup is
                                faster.</para>
