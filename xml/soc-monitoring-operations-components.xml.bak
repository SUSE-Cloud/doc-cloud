 <para>
  <phrase>SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</phrase> relies on OpenStack as
  technology for building cloud computing platforms for public and private
  clouds. OpenStack consists of a series of interrelated projects delivering
  various components for a cloud infrastructure solution and allowing for the
  deployment and management of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platforms.

 <section id="monitoring-service">
  <title>Monitoring Service</title>
 <para>
  The Monitoring Service is the central <phrase>SUSE OpenStack Cloud
  Monitoring</phrase> component. It is responsible for receiving, persisting,
  and processing metrics and log data, as well as providing the data to the
  users.
 </para>
 <para>
  The Monitoring Service relies on Monasca. It uses Monasca for high-speed
  metrics querying and integrates the streaming alarm engine and the
  notification engine of Monasca. For details, refer to the
  <ulink url="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Monasca">Monasca Wiki</ulink>.

 <section id="horizon-plugin">
  <title>Horizon Plugin</title>
 <para>
  <phrase>SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</phrase> comes with a plugin for the
  OpenStack Horizon dashboard. The Horizon plugin extends the main dashboard in
  OpenStack with a view for monitoring. This enables <phrase>SUSE OpenStack
  Cloud Monitoring</phrase> users to access the monitoring and log management
  functions from a central Web-based graphical user interface. Metrics and log
  data are visualized on a comfortable and easy-to-use dashboard.
 </para>
 <para>
  For details, refer to the
  <ulink url="http://docs.openstack.org/developer/horizon/">OpenStack Horizon
  documentation</ulink>.
 </para>
 <para>

  which it runs and sending the metrics data to the Monitoring Service. The
  agent supports metrics from a variety of sources as well as a number of
  built-in system and service checks.
 </para>
 <para>
  A Metrics Agent can be installed on each virtual or physical server to be
  monitored.
 </para>
 <para>
  The agent functionality is fully integrated into the source code base of the
  Monasca project. For details, refer to the
