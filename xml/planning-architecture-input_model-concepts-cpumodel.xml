  <title>CPU Model</title>


  <para>CPU models define how CPUs of a server will be used. The model allows CPUs to be assigned
    for use by components such as Nova (for VMs) and Open vSwitch (for DPDK). It also allows those
    CPUs to be isolated from the general kernel SMP balancing and scheduling algorithms.</para>


  <para>CPU models also provide CPU sizing information for virtual machine servers.</para>


  <para>CPU models are optional - it is valid to have a server role without a cpu model.</para>
