 <title>CPU Model</title>
 <para>
  CPU models define how CPUs of a server will be used. The model allows CPUs to
  be assigned for use by components such as Nova (for VMs) and Open vSwitch
  (for DPDK). It also allows those CPUs to be isolated from the general kernel
  SMP balancing and scheduling algorithms.
 </para>
 <para>
  CPU models also provide CPU sizing information for virtual machine servers.
 </para>
 <para>
  CPU models are optional - it is valid to have a server role without a cpu
  model.
