        <para>To register your system, provide the E-mail address associated with the SUSE account
                you or your organization uses to manage subscriptions. In case you do not have a
                SUSE account yet, go to the SUSE Customer Center home page (<link
                        xlink:href="https://scc.suse.com/">https://scc.suse.com/</link>) to create
                one. </para>
        <para>Enter the Registration Code you received with your copy of SUSE Linux Enterprise
                Server. Proceed with Next to start the registration process. </para>
        <para>By default the system is registered with the SUSE Customer Center. However, if your
                organization provides local regsitration servers you can either choose one form the
                list of auto-detected servers or provide the URl at "Register System via local SMT
                Server". Proceed with "Next". </para>
        <para>During the registration, the online update repositories will be added to your
                installation setup. When finished, you can choose whether to install the latest
                available package versions from the update repositories. This ensures that SUSE
                Linux Enterprise Server is installed with the latest security updates available. If
                you choose No, all packages will be installed from the installation media. Proceed
                with Next. </para>
        <para> If the system was successfully registered during installation, YaST will disable
                repositories from local installation media such as CD/DVD or flash disks when the
                installation has been completed. This prevents problems if the installation source
                is no longer available and ensures that you always get the latest updates from the
                online repositories. </para>
