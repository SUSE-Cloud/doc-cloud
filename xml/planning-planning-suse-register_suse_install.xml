  To register your system, provide the E-mail address associated with the
  &suse; account you or your organization uses to manage subscriptions. In case
  you do not have a &suse; account yet, go to the &scc; home page
  (<link
                        xlink:href="https://scc.suse.com/"/>) to
  create one.

  Enter the Registration Code you received with your copy of &sles;. Proceed
  with <guimenu>Next</guimenu> to start the registration process.

  By default the system is registered with the &scc;. However, if your
  organization provides local registration servers you can either choose one
  form the list of auto-detected servers or provide the URL at
  <literal>Register System via local SMT Server</literal>. Proceed with
  <guimenu>Next</guimenu>.

  During the registration, the online update repositories will be added to your
  installation setup. When finished, you can choose whether to install the
  latest available package versions from the update repositories. This ensures
  that &sles; is installed with the latest security updates available. If you
  choose No, all packages will be installed from the installation media.
  Proceed with Next.

 <para>
  If the system was successfully registered during installation, &yast; will
  disable repositories from local installation media such as CD/DVD or flash
  disks when the installation has been completed. This prevents problems if the
  installation source is no longer available and ensures that you always get
  the latest updates from the online repositories.
