  Before contacting support to help you with a problem on &cloud;, we
  strongly recommended that you gather as much information about your system
  and the problem as possible. For this purpose, &productname; ships with a
  tool called <command>supportconfig</command>. It gathers system information
  such as the current kernel version being used, the hardware, RPM database,
  partitions, and other items. <command>supportconfig</command> also collects
  the most important log files, making it easier for the supporters to
  identify and solve your problem.

   This problem may occur the first time the Log Management Window is opened.
   It occurs because the Elasticsearch index for the Monasca project does not
   yet exist. A browser reload should fix the problem in most cases.

   This problem happens when you were previously logged into Horizon and the
   session expired, leaving a stale session state that confuses Kibana. In
   this case, re-login to Horizon and then reload Kibana to fix the problem.

   This may be due to an overly narrow time window (that is, no logs were sent
   in the last 15 minutes, which is the default time window). Try increasing
   the time window with the drop-down box in the screen's top right corner. If
   the problem persists verify that log agents are running properly; make sure
   the <literal>openstack-monasca-log-agent</literal> service is running and
   check <filename>/var/log/monasca-log-agent/agent.log</filename> for errors
   on the agent nodes.
