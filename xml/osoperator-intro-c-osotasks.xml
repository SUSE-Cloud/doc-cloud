 <title>The OpenStack Operator's Tasks</title>
 <para>
  In order to use <phrase>CMM</phrase> for monitoring your OpenStack services
  and servers, you must install and configure so-called agents:
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     A Metrics Agent is required for monitoring your services and servers.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     A Log Agent is required for collecting the log data that is generated for
     your services and servers.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
 </para>
 <bridgehead renderas="sect4">Monitoring </bridgehead>
 <para>
  A Metrics Agent can be installed on each virtual or physical server where
  services to be monitored are provisioned. The agent is responsible for
  querying metrics and sending them to the Monitoring Service for further
  processing.
 </para>
 <para id="Metrics-represent-self-descri-concept-conbody-section-3-p">
  Metrics are self-describing data structures that are uniquely identified by a
  name and a set of dimensions. Each dimension consists of a key/value pair
  that allows for a flexible and concise description of the data to be
  monitored, for example, region, availability zone, service tier, or resource
  ID.
 </para>
 <para id="idg-osoperator-intro-c-osotasks-xml-4">
  The Metrics Agent supports various types of metrics including the following:
 </para>
 <itemizedlist id="System-metrics-for-example-concept-conbody-section-3-ul">
  <listitem>
   <para>
    System metrics, for example, CPU usage, consumed disk space, or network
    traffic.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Host alive checks. The agent can perform active checks on a host to
    determine whether it is alive using ping (ICMP) or SSH.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Process checks. The agent can check and monitor a process, for example, the
    number of instances, memory size, or number of threads.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    HTTP endpoint checks. The agent can perform up/down checks on HTTP
    endpoints by sending an HTTP request and reporting success or failure to
    the Monitoring Service.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Service checks. The agent can check middleware services, for example,
    MySQL, Kafka, or RabbitMQ.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    OpenStack services. The agent can perform specific checks on each process
    that is part of an OpenStack service.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Log metrics. The agent can check and monitor the number of critical log
    entries in the log data retrieved from the cloud resources.
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </itemizedlist>
 <para>
  Your individual agent configuration determines which metrics are available
  for monitoring your services and servers. For details on installing and
  configuring a Metrics Agent, refer to
  <xref linkend="idg-osoperator-install-c-osoinstmetricsagent-xml-1"/>.
 </para>
 <para>
  As soon as an agent is available, you have access to the <phrase>CMM</phrase>
  monitoring features. You work with a graphical user interface that is
  seamlessly integrated into your cloud infrastructure. Based on OpenStack
  Horizon, the user interface enables access to all monitoring functionality
  and the resulting large-scale monitoring data. A comfortable dashboard
  visualizes the health and status of your cloud resources.
 </para>
 <para>
  <phrase>CMM</phrase> provides functions for alarm and notification
  management. <phrase>Template-based alarm definitions allow for monitoring a
  dynamically changing set of resources without the need for reconfiguration.
  While the number of underlying virtual machines is changing, for example,
  this ensures the efficient monitoring of scalable cloud services. Alarm
  definitions allow you to specify expressions that are evaluated based on the
  metrics data that is received. Alarm definitions can be combined to form
  compound alarms. Compound alarms allow you to track and process even more
  complex events. Notifications can be configured in order to inform
  <phrase>CMM</phrase> users when an alarm is triggered.</phrase>

  <xref linkend="idg-shared-monitor-c-monitor-xml-1"/>.
 </para>
 <bridgehead renderas="sect4">Log Management</bridgehead>
 <para>
  A Log Agent can be installed and configured on each physical and virtual
  server where log data is to be retrieved. The agent collects the log data
  from the services and servers and sends them to the Monitoring Service for
  further processing. For details on installing and configuring a Log Agent,
  refer to <xref linkend="idg-osoperator-install-c-osoinstlogagent-xml-1"/>.
 </para>
 <para>
  <phrase>CMM</phrase> stores the log data in a central database. This forms
  the basis for visualizing the log data for the <phrase>CMM</phrase> users.
  Advanced data analysis and visualization of the log data is supported in a
  variety of charts, tables, and maps. Visualizations can easily be combined in
  dynamic dashboards that display changes to search queries in real time.
 </para>
 <para>
  Based on OpenStack Horizon, the customizable dashboards are seamlessly
  integrated into your cloud infrastructure. They enable user access to all log
  management functionality.
 </para>
 <para>
  GUI-based alarm and notification management is also supported for log data.
  Based on a template mechanism, you can configure alarms and notifications to
  monitor the number of critical log events over time. Compound alarms can be
  created to analyze more complex log events. This automation of log handling
  guarantees that you can identify problems in your their infrastructure early
  and find the root cause quickly.
