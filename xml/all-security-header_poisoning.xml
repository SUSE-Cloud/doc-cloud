    <sidebar><para> Depending on the environment and context of your &kw-hos; deployment, it
      may be advisable to configure Horizon to protect against Host header poisoning (see ref. #1
      below) by using Django's ALLOWED_HOSTS setting (see ref. #2 below). To configure Horizon to
      use the ALLOWED_HOSTS setting, take the following steps: </para>

        <listitem><para>Edit the haproxy settings to reconfigure the health check for Horizon to specify the
          allowed hostname(s). This needs to be done first, before configuring Horizon itself.
          Otherwise, if Horizon is first configured to restrict the values of the "Host" header on
          incoming HTTP requests, the haproxy health checks will start to fail. So, the haproxy
          configuration needs to be updated first, if this is being done on an existing
          installation. </para>

              In this example, my.example.com is the hostname associated with the Horizon VIP on the
              external API network. However, you aren't restricted to just one allowed host. In
              addition, allowed hosts can contain wildcards (though not in the horizon.yml file;
              there you must have an actual resolvable hostname or a routeable IP address). However,
              for this change to the haproxy healthcheck, it is suggested that the hostname
              associated with the Horizon VIP on the external API network be used. </para>
