 <title>Working with the Log Management Window</title>
 <para>
  Index patterns determine which data from the underlying Elasticsearch
  database can be viewed and analyzed in <phrase>SUSE OpenStack Cloud
  Monitoring</phrase>'s log management window. Index patterns are used to
  identify the Elasticsearch indices to run search and analytics against.
 </para>
 <para>
  <phrase>SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</phrase> ships with a preconfigured
  index pattern which allows you to instantly view and analyze your log data
  when accessing the log management window for the first time. You can
  configure additional index patterns to view and analyze different data from
  different indices.
 </para>
 <para>
  Search queries allow you to search the Elasticsearch indices for data that
  match your information requirements. The query results can be graphically
  represented in visualizations, and visualizations can be organized in
  dashboards.

 <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Below the main navigation bar at the top of the window, there is a
    <emphasis role="bold">search box</emphasis> for querying your log data. By
    submitting a query, you search all indices that match the current index
    pattern. The name of the current index pattern is displayed directly below
    the search box on the left side. You can select a different index pattern,
    if required.
   </para>
   <para>
    For entering strings in the search box, use the Lucene query syntax. Kibana
    also supports the Elasticsearch Query DSL. For details, refer to the
