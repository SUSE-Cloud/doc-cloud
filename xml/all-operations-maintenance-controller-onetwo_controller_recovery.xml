      <listitem><para>Your lifecycle manager is still intact and working.</para>
</listitem>
      <listitem><para>One or two of your controller nodes went down, but not the entire cluster.</para>

            <literal>~/helion/my_cloud/definition/data/servers.yml</literal> file is correct for your
          controller node. You may need to replace the existing information if you had to either
          replacement your entire controller node or just pieces of it.</para>
</listitem>
        <listitem><para>If you made changes to your <literal>servers.yml</literal> file then commit those changes

            <listitem><para>If you replaced your controller node with a completely new machine, you need to

            take a look at <emphasis role="bold">info/server_info.yml</emphasis> to see if the assignment of the node you have
            added is what you expect. It may not be, as nodes will not be numbered consecutively if
            any have previously been removed. This is to prevent loss of data; the config processor
            retains data about removed nodes and keeps their ID numbers from being reallocated. See
            the Persisted Server Allocations section in  for information
            on how this works.</para>
