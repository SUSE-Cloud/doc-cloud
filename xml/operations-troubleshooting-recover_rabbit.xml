 <title>Understanding and Recovering &rabbit; after Failure</title>
 <para>
  &rabbit; is the message queue service that runs on each of your controller
  nodes and brokers communication between multiple services in your
  &productname; cloud environment. It is important for cloud operators to
  understand how different troubleshooting scenarios affect &rabbit; so they
  can minimize downtime in their environments. We are going to discuss multiple
  scenarios and how it affects &rabbit;. We will also explain how you can
  recover from them if there are issues.
 </para>

 <section xml:id="idg-all-operations-troubleshooting-recover_rabbit-xml-7">
  <title>How upgrades affect &rabbit;</title>
  <para>
   There are two types of upgrades within &productname; -- major and minor. The
   effect that the upgrade process has on &rabbit; depends on these types.
  </para>
  <para>
   A major upgrade is defined by an erlang change or major version upgrade of
   &rabbit;. A minor upgrade would be an upgrade where &rabbit; stays within
   the same version, such as v3.4.3 to v.3.4.6.
  </para>
  <para>
   During both types of upgrades there may be minor blips in the authentication
   process of client services as the accounts are recreated.
  </para>
  <para>
   <emphasis role="bold">&rabbit; during a major upgrade</emphasis>
  </para>
  <para>
   There will be a &rabbit; service outage while the upgrade is performed.
  </para>
  <para>
   During the upgrade, high availability consistency is compromised -- all but
   the primary node will go down and will be reset, meaning their database
   copies are deleted. The primary node is not taken down until the last step
   and then it is upgrade. The database of users and permissions is maintained
   during this process. Then the other nodes are brought back into the cluster
   and resynchronized.
  </para>
  <para>
   <emphasis role="bold">&rabbit; during a minor upgrade</emphasis>
  </para>
  <para>
   Minor upgrades are performed node by node. This "rolling" process means
   there should be no overall service outage because each node is taken out of
   its cluster in turn, its database is reset, and then it is added back to the
   cluster and resynchronized.
  </para>
 </section>
 <section xml:id="idg-all-operations-troubleshooting-recover_rabbit-xml-8">
  <title>How &rabbit; is affected by other operational processes</title>
  <para>
   There are operational tasks, such as <xref linkend="stop_restart"/>, where
   you use the <filename>ardana-stop.yml</filename> and
   <filename>ardana-start.yml</filename> playbooks to gracefully restart your cloud.
   If you use these playbooks, and there are no errors associated with them
   forcing you to troubleshoot further, then &rabbit; is brought down
   gracefully and brought back up. There is nothing special to note regarding
   &rabbit; in these normal operational processes.
  </para>
  <para>
   However, there are other scenarios where an understanding of &rabbit; is
   important when a graceful shutdown did not occur.
  </para>
  <para>
   These examples that follow assume you are using one of the entry-scale
   models where &rabbit; is hosted on your controller node cluster. If you are
   using a mid-scale model or have a dedicated cluster that &rabbit; lives on
   you may need to alter the steps accordingly. To determine which nodes
   &rabbit; is on you can use the <filename>rabbit-status.yml</filename> playbook
   from your &clm;.
  </para>

  <para>
   <emphasis role="bold">Your entire control plane cluster goes down</emphasis>
  </para>
  <para>
   If you have a scenario where all of your controller nodes went down, either
   manually or via another process such as a power outage, then an
   understanding of how &rabbit; should be brought back up is important. Follow
   these steps to recover &rabbit; on your controller node cluster in these
   cases:
  </para>
  <procedure>
   <step>
    <para>
     The order in which the nodes went down is key here. Locate the last node
     to go down as this will be used as the primary node when bringing the
     &rabbit; cluster back up. You can review the timestamps in the
     <filename>/var/log/rabbitmq</filename> log file to determine what the last
     node was.
    </para>
    <note>
     <para>
      The <literal>primary</literal> status of a node is transient, it only applies for the
      duration that this process is running. There is no long-term distinction
      between any of the nodes in your cluster. The primary node is simply
      the one that owns the &rabbit; configuration database that will be
      synchronized across the cluster.
     </para>
    </note>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Run the <filename>ardana-start.yml</filename> playbook specifying the primary
     node (aka the last node down determined in the first step):
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.ardana;cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/ardana/ansible
&prompt.ardana;ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts ardana-start.yml -e rabbit_primary_hostname=&lt;hostname&gt;</screen>
    <note>
     <para>
      The <literal>&lt;hostname&gt;</literal> value will be the "shortname" for
      your node, as found in the <filename>/etc/hosts</filename> file.
     </para>
    </note>
   </step>
  </procedure>
  <para>
   <emphasis role="bold">If one of your controller nodes goes down</emphasis>
  </para>
  <para>
   First step here is to determine whether the controller that went down is the
   primary &rabbit; host or not. The primary host is going to be the first host
   member in the <literal>FND-RMQ</literal> group in the file below on your
   &clm;:
  </para>
<screen>&prompt.ardana;~/scratch/ansible/next/ardana/ansible/hosts/verb_hosts</screen>
  <para>
   In this example below, <literal>ardana-cp1-c1-m1-mgmt</literal> would be the

ardana-cp1-c1-m3-mgmt</screen>
  <para>
   If your primary &rabbit; controller node has gone down and you need to bring
   it back up, you can follow these steps. In this playbook you are using the
   <literal>rabbit_primary_hostname</literal> parameter to specify the hostname
   for one of the other controller nodes in your environment hosting &rabbit;,
   which will service as the primary node in the recovery. You will also use
   the <literal>--limit</literal> parameter to specify the controller node you
   are attempting to bring back up.
  </para>
<screen>&prompt.ardana;cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/ardana/ansible

  <para>
   If the node you need to bring back is <emphasis role="bold">not</emphasis>
   the primary &rabbit; node then you can just run the
   <filename>ardana-start.yml</filename> playbook with the
   <literal>--limit</literal> parameter and your node should recover:

   The same general process noted above is used if you are removing or
   replacing one or more of your controller nodes.
  </para>
  <para>
   If your node needs minor hardware repairs, but does not need to be replaced
   with a new node, you should use the <filename>ardana-stop.yml</filename> playbook
   with the <literal>--limit</literal> parameter to stop services on that node
   prior to removing it from the cluster.

    <para>
     Run the <filename>rabbitmq-stop.yml</filename> playbook, specifying the

     &rabbit; cluster:

   <step>
    <para>
     Run the <filename>ardana-stop.yml</filename> playbook, again specifying the

   </step>
  </procedure>
  <para>
   If your node cannot be repaired and needs to be replaced with another
   baremetal node, any references to the replaced node must be removed from the
   &rabbit; cluster. This is because &rabbit; associates a cookie with each
   node in the cluster which is derived, in part, by the specific hardware.  So
   it is possible to replace a hard drive in a node. However changing a
   motherboard or replacing the node with another node entirely may cause
   &rabbit; to stop working. When this happens, the running &rabbit; cluster
   must be edited from a running &rabbit; node. The following steps show how to
   do this.
  </para>
  <para>
   In this example, controller 3 is the node being replaced with the following
   steps:
  </para>
  <procedure>

   If the node you are removing/replacing is your primary host then when you
