 <title>Configuring Availability of Alarm Metrics</title>
 <para>
  Using the Monasca agent tuning knobs, you can choose which alarm metrics are
  available in your environment.
 </para>
 <para>
  The addition of the libvirt and OVS plugins to the Monasca agent provides a
  number of additional metrics that can be used. Most of these metrics are
  included by default, but others are not. You have the ability to use tuning
  knobs to add or remove these metrics to your environment based on your
  individual needs in your cloud.
 </para>
 <para>
  We will list these metrics along with the tuning knob name and instructions
  for how to adjust these.
