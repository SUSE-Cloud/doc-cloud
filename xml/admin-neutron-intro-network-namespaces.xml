  <title>Network namespaces</title>
  <para>A namespace is a way of scoping a particular set of identifiers. Using a
            namespace, you can use the same identifier multiple times in different
            namespaces. You can also restrict an identifier set visible to particular
            processes.</para>
  <para>For example, Linux provides namespaces for networking and processes, among
            other things. If a process is running within a process namespace, it can only
            see and communicate with other processes in the same namespace. So, if a shell
            in a particular process namespace ran <command>ps waux</command>, it would only show
            the other processes in the same namespace.</para>

    <title>Linux network namespaces</title>
    <para>In a network namespace, the scoped identifiers are network devices; so a
                given network device, such as <literal>eth0</literal>, exists in a particular namespace.
                Linux starts up with a default network namespace, so if your operating system
                does not do anything special, that is where all the network devices will be
                located. But it is also possible to create further non-default namespaces, and
                create new devices in those namespaces, or to move an existing device from one
                namespace to another.</para>
    <para>Each network namespace also has its own routing table, and in fact this is the
                main reason for namespaces to exist. A routing table is keyed by destination IP
                address, so network namespaces are what you need if you want the same
                destination IP address to mean different things at different times - which is
                something that OpenStack Networking requires for its feature of providing
                overlapping IP addresses in different virtual networks.</para>
    <para>Each network namespace also has its own set of iptables (for both IPv4 and
                IPv6). So, you can apply different security to flows with the same IP
                addressing in different namespaces, as well as different routing.</para>
    <para>Any given Linux process runs in a particular network namespace. By default this
                is inherited from its parent process, but a process with the right capabilities
                can switch itself into a different namespace; in practice this is mostly done
                using the <command>ip netns exec NETNS COMMAND...</command> invocation, which starts
                <literal>COMMAND</literal> running in the namespace named <literal>NETNS</literal>. Suppose such a process
                sends out a message to IP address A.B.C.D, the effect of the namespace is that
                A.B.C.D will be looked up in that namespaceâ€™s routing table, and that will
                determine the network device that the message is transmitted through.</para>

    <title>Virtual routing and forwarding (VRF)</title>
    <para>Virtual routing and forwarding is an IP technology that allows multiple
                instances of a routing table to coexist on the same router at the same time.
                It is another name for the network namespace functionality described above.</para>
