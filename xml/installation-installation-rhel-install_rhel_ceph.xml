 <title>Using RHEL as a Ceph Client</title>


    <para>&kw-hos-phrase; supports the use of a RHEL compute node (specifically
        RHEL 7.2) as a Ceph client node. However, the rpm packages (to be installed on the RHEL
        compute nodes) to enable it to act as a Ceph client are not shipped with &kw-hos-phrase;. So, you will need to provide the necessary rpm packages on the
        &kw-hos; lifecycle manager node. This document describes the steps to achieve this.
