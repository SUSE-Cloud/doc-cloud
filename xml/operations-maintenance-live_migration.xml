 <title>Live Migration of Instances</title>
 <para>
  Live migration allows you to move active compute instances between compute
  nodes, allowing for less downtime during maintenance.
 </para>
 <para>
  &kw-hos; Nova offers a set of commands that allow you to move compute
  instances between compute hosts. Which command you use will depend on the
  state of the host, what operating system is on the host, what type of storage
  the instances are using, and whether you want to migrate a single instance or
  all of the instances off of the host. We will describe these options on this
  page as well as give you step-by-step instructions for performing them.

   <emphasis role="bold">If your compute node has failed</emphasis>
  </para>
  <para>
   A compute host failure could be caused by hardware failure, such as the data
   disk needing to be replaced, power has been lost, or any other type of
   failure which requires that you replace the baremetal host. In this
   scenario, the instances on the compute node are unrecoverable and any data
   on the local ephemeral storage is lost. If you are utilizing block storage
   volumes, either as a boot device or as additional storage, they should be
   unaffected.
  </para>
  <para>
   In these cases you will want to use one of the Nova evacuate commands, which
   will cause Nova to rebuild the instances on other hosts.

  <para>
   If your compute host is active, powered on and the data disks are in working order
   you can utilize the migration commands to migrate your compute instances.
   There are two migration features, "cold" migration (also referred to simply
   as "migration") and live migration. Migration and live migration are two
   different functions.
  </para>
  <para>
   <emphasis role="bold">Cold migration</emphasis> is used to copy an instances
   data in a <literal>SHUTOFF</literal> status from one compute host to
   another. It does this using passwordless SSH access which has security
   concerns associated with it. For this reason, the <literal>nova
   migrate</literal> function has been disabled by default but you have the
   ability to enable this feature if you would like. Details on how to do this
   can be found in <xref linkend="enabling_the_nova_resize"/>.
  </para>
  <para>
   <emphasis role="bold">Live migration</emphasis> can be performed on
   instances in either an <literal>ACTIVE</literal> or
   <literal>PAUSED</literal> state and uses the QEMU hypervisor to manage the
   copy of the running processes and associated resources to the destination
   compute host using the hypervisors own protocol and thus is a more secure
   method and allows for less downtime. There may be a short network outage,
   usually a few milliseconds but could be up to a few seconds if your compute
   instances are busy, during a live migration. Also there may be some
   performance degredation during the process.
  </para>
  <para>
   The compute host must remain powered on during the migration process.
  </para>
  <para>
   Both the cold migration and live migration options will honor Nova group
   policies, which includes affinity settings. There is a limitation to keep in
   mind if you use group policies and that is discussed in the
   <xref linkend="liveInstMigration"/> section.

    <para>
     If your instance is booted from a block storage volume or has any number
     of block storage volumes attached, use the <literal>nova
     live-migration</literal> command with this syntax:
    </para>
<screen>nova live-migration &lt;instance uuid&gt; [&lt;target compute host&gt;]</screen>
    <para>
     If your instance has local (ephemeral) disk(s) only or if your instance
     has a mix of ephemeral disk(s) and block storage volume(s), you should use
     the <literal>--block-migrate</literal> option:
    </para>
<screen>nova live-migration --block-migrate &lt;instance uuid&gt; [&lt;target compute host&gt;]</screen>
    <note>
     <para>
      The <literal>[&lt;target compute host&gt;]</literal> option is
      optional. If you do not specify a target host then the nova scheduler
      will choose a node for you.
     </para>
    </note>
    <para>
     <emphasis role="bold">Multiple instances</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     If you want to live migrate all of the instances off a single compute host
     you can utilize the <literal>nova host-evacuate-live</literal> command.
    </para>
    <para>
     Issue the host-evacuate-live command, which will begin the live migration
     process.
    </para>
    <para>
     If all of the instances on the host are using at least one local
     (ephemeral) disk, you should use this syntax:
    </para>
<screen>nova host-evacuate-live --block-migrate &lt;hostname&gt;</screen>
    <para>
     Alternatively, if all of the instances are only using block storage
     volumes then omit the <literal>--block-migrate</literal> option:
    </para>
<screen>nova host-evacuate-live &lt;hostname&gt;</screen>
    <note>
     <para>
      You can either let the nova-scheduler choose a suitable target host or
      you can specify one using the
      <literal>--target-host &lt;hostname&gt;</literal> switch. See
      <command>nova help host-evacuate-live</command> for details.
     </para>
