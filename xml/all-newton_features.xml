<para>Non-core services (listed in the Features tables below) are provided as-is. Some non-core
        services are included in this release to provide early access to features that HPE may
        support fully in future releases, but HPE cannot guarantee that support will be provided or
        issues resolved in a future release. Other non-core features are provided in this release
        for a limited time and may be deprecated in future releases. HPE will attempt to provide
        guidance and telephone support for these features at its discretion. If you need additional
        support on any of these features for a specific use case, please contact the Helion
        professional services team. </para>
