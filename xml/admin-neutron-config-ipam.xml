  <title>IPAM configuration</title>

  <para>Starting with the Liberty release, OpenStack Networking includes a pluggable
            interface for the IP Address Management (IPAM) function. This interface creates
            a driver framework for the allocation and de-allocation of subnets and IP
            addresses, enabling the integration of alternate IPAM implementations or
            third-party IP Address Management systems.</para>
  <section>
    <title>The basics</title>
    <para>In Liberty and Mitaka, the IPAM implementation within OpenStack Networking
                provided a pluggable and non-pluggable flavor. As of Newton, the non-pluggable
                flavor is no longer available. Instead, it is completely replaced with a
                reference driver implementation of the pluggable framework. All data will
                be automatically migrated during the upgrade process, unless you have
                previously configured a pluggable IPAM driver. In that case, no migration
                is necessary.</para>
    <para>To configure a driver other than the reference driver, specify it
                in the <literal>neutron.conf</literal> file. Do this after the migration is
                complete. There is no need to specify any value if you wish to use the
                reference driver.</para>
    <screen language="ini">ipam_driver = ipam-driver-name</screen>
    <para>There is no need to specify any value if you wish to use the reference
                driver, though specifying <literal>internal</literal> will explicitly choose the reference
                driver. The documentation for any alternate drivers will include the value to
                use when specifying that driver.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>The driver interface is designed to allow separate drivers for each
                        subnet pool. However, the current implementation allows only a single
                        IPAM driver system-wide.</para>

        <para>Third-party drivers must provide their own migration mechanisms to convert
                        existing OpenStack installations to their IPAM.</para>
