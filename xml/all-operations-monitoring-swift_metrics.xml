                <para>This metric reports the total length of all async pending queues in the
                  system.</para>

                <para>When a container update fails, the update is placed on the async pending queue.
                  An update may fail becuase the container server is too busy or because the server
                  is down or failed. Later the system will “replay” updates from the queue – so
                  eventually, the container listings will show all objects known to the system.</para>

                <para>If you know that container servers are down, it is normal to see the value of
                  async pending increase. Once the server is restored, the value should return to
                  zero.</para>

                <para>A non-zero value may also indicate that containers are too large. Look for “lock
                  timeout” messages in /var/log/swift/swift.log. If you find such messages consider
                  reducing the container size or enable rate limiting.</para>

                than one error reported, the list of errors is paired to the last reported error and
                the operator is expected to resolve failures until no more are reported. Where there
                are no further reported errors, the Value Class is emitted as ‘Ok’.</entry>

                just as important as swiftlm.diskusage.usage.avg. For example, if
                swiftlm.diskusage.usage.avg is 70% you might think that there is plenty of space
                available. However, if swiftlm.diskusage.usage.max is 100%, this means that some
                objects cannot be stored on that drive. Swift will store replicas on other drives.
                However, this will create extra overhead.</entry>

                periodically and hence this value will decrease whenever a replicator completes.
                However, if a replicator is not completing a cycle, this value increases (by one
                second for each second that the replicator is not completing). If the value remains
                high and increasing for a long period of time, it indicates that one of the hosts is

                periodically and hence this value will decrease whenever a replicator completes.
                However, if a replicator is not completing a cycle, this value increases (by one
                second for each second that the replicator is not completing). If the value remains

              <entry>This metric reports the average of all the collected records in the
                swiftlm.umon.target.val.avail_minute metric data. This is a walking average data set
                of these approximately per-minute states of the Swift Object Store. The most basic
                case is a whole day of successful per-minute records, which will average to 100%
                availability. If there is any downtime throughout the day resulting in gaps of data
                which are two minutes or longer, the per-minute availability data will be “back
                filled” with an assumption of a down state for all the per-minute records which did
                not exist during the non-reported time. Because this is a walking average of
                approximately 24 hours worth of data, any outtage will take 24 hours to be purged
                from the dataset.<para>A 24-hour average availability

              <entry>A value of 100 indicates that swift-uptime-monitor was able to get a token from
                Keystone and was able to perform operations against the Swift API during the
