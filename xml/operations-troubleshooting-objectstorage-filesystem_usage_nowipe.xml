 <title>Troubleshooting Swift File System Usage Issues</title>
<!---->
 <para>
  If you have recycled your environment to do a re-installation and you haven't
  run the <literal>wipe_disks.yml</literal> playbook in the process, you may
  experience an issue where your file system usage continues to grow
  exponentially even though you are not adding any files to your Swift system.
  This is likely occurring because the quarantined directory is getting filled
  up. You can find this directory at
  <literal>/srv/node/disk0/quarantined</literal>.
 </para>
 <para>
  You can resolve this issue by following these steps:
 </para>
 <procedure>
  <step>
   <para>
    SSH to each of your Swift nodes and stop the replication processes on each
    of them. The following commands must be executed on each of your Swift
    nodes. Make note of the time that you performed this action as you will
    reference it in step three.
   </para>
<screen>sudo systemctl stop swift-account-replicator
sudo systemctl stop swift-container-replicator
sudo systemctl stop swift-object-replicator</screen>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>
    Examine the <literal>/var/log/swift/swift.log</literal> file for events
    that indicate when the auditor processes have started and completed audit
    cycles. For more details, see <xref linkend="swift_filesystem_ts"/>.
   </para>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>
    Wait until you see that the auditor processes have finished two complete
    cycles since the time you stopped the replication processes (from step
    one). You must check every Swift node, which on a lightly loaded system
    that was recently installed this should take less than two hours.
   </para>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>
    At this point you should notice that your quarantined directory has stopped
    growing. You may now delete the files in that directory on each of your
    nodes.
   </para>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>
    Restart the replication processes using the Swift start playbook:
   </para>
   <substeps>
    <step>
     <para>
      Log in to the &clm;.
     </para>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      Run the Swift start playbook:
     </para>
<screen>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/ardana/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts swift-start.yml</screen>
    </step>

  <title>Examining the Swift Log for Audit Event Cycles</title>
  <para>
   Below is an example of the <literal>object-server</literal> start and end
   cycle details. They were taken by using the following command on a Swift
   node:
  </para>
<screen>sudo grep object-auditor /var/log/swift/swift.log|grep ALL</screen>
  <para>
   Example output:
  </para>
<screen>$ sudo grep object-auditor /var/log/swift/swift.log|grep ALL

   In this next example, the <literal>account-auditor</literal> and
   <literal>container-auditor</literal> use similar message structure, so we
   only show the container auditor. You can substitute
   <literal>account</literal> for <literal>container</literal> as well:
