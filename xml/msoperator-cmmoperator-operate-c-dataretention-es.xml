 <title>Configuring Log Data Retention</title>
 <para>
  Log data is stored in the Elasticsearch database. Elasticsearch stores the
  data in indices. <phrase>SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</phrase> uses
  Elasticsearch Curator for managing data retention of these indices.
  Elasticsearch Curator jobs are automatically run by a Cron daemon that
  executes scheduled commands defined in a <literal>crontab</literal>
  configuration file. <phrase>SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</phrase> allows
  you to configure Elasticsearch Curator and the Cron daemon to define your
  data retention policies as required by your monitoring environment.
 </para>
 <para>
  By default, an Elasticsearch index is automatically deleted in <phrase>SUSE
  OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</phrase> if it is older than 60 days. The delete
  job is executed every day at midnight.
 </para>
 <para>
  Proceed as follows to change the data retention settings that were defined
  when installing the Monitoring Service:
 </para>
 <orderedlist>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Log in to the host where the Monitoring Service is installed.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Open the <literal>curator_action.yml</literal> file with your favorite
    editor. It defines how long you keep the data in the database.
   </para>
   <para>
    Example:
   </para>
<screen>sudo vim /etc/monasca/elastisearch-curator/curator_action.yml</screen>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Specify the time span after which you want indices to be removed. It is
    defined by the <literal>unit_count</literal> parameter in the
    <literal>action: delete_indices</literal> section.
   </para>
   <para>
    Example for a time span of 30 days:
   </para>
<screen>unit_count: 30</screen>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Edit the <literal>crontab</literal> configuration file which contains the
    list of commands to be run at the specified times. These commands are
    checked by the Cron daemon and then executed in the system background.
   </para>
   <para>
    Edit the configuration file, for example, as follows:
   </para>
<screen>sudo curator
crontab -e</screen>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    To specify when to run a job, edit the entry in the file. The default is as
    follows:
   </para>
<screen>0 0 * * * /opt/elasticsearch-curator/bin/curator 
--config /etc/monasca/elasticsearch-curator/curator_config.yml 
/etc/monasca/elasticsearch-curator/curator_action.yml</screen>
   <para>
    Each line starts with five fields for defining the time/date, followed by a
    command, followed by a newline character (<literal>\n</literal>). The
    fields are separated by spaces, they must not contain spaces:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Field 1 defines the minute. Use any integer from <literal>0</literal> to
      <literal>59</literal>.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Field 2 defines the hour. Use any integer from <literal>0</literal> to
      <literal>23</literal> where <literal>0</literal> represents midnight.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Field 3 defines the day of the month. Use any integer from
      <literal>1</literal> to <literal>31</literal>.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Field 4 defines the month. Use any integer from <literal>1</literal> to
      <literal>12</literal>.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Field 5 defines the day of the week. Use any integer from
      <literal>0</literal> to <literal>7</literal> where <literal>0</literal>
      or <literal>7</literal> represent Sundays.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      <literal>month</literal>.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   <para>
    Example:
   </para>
<screen>30 04 1 1 * /usr/bin/directory/command</screen>
   <para>
    The above example will run <literal>/usr/bin/directory/command</literal> at
    4:30 am on January 1st.
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </orderedlist>
 <para>
  As soon as you have saved your changes, your new data retention policy takes
  effect.
