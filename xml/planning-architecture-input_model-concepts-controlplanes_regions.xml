 <title>Control Planes and Regions</title>
 <para>
  A region in OpenStack terms is a collection of URLs that together provide a
  consistent set of services (Nova, Neutron, Swift, etc). Regions are
  represented in the &o_ident; identity service catalog. In &productname;,
  multiple regions are not supported. Only <literal>Region0</literal> is valid.
 </para>
<!--
 <para>
  For the owner of a cloud, regions provide a way of segmenting resources for
  scale, resilience, and isolation.
 </para>
 <para>
  Regions do not have to be disjointed. For example, you can have a Swift
  service shared across more than one region, in which case the Swift URL for
  both regions will be the same and any region-specific services will use the
  same Swift instance. However, not all services can be shared in this way. For
  example, a Neutron service cannot be used by more than one Nova and so these
  will generally be deployed as region specific services, provided from
  separate control-planes. Equally in &kw-hos;, &mariadb; and RabbitMQ cannot
  be shared by more than one instance of the same service (for example a single
  &mariadb; cluster cannot be used by two different instances of Nova, and so
  these are also deployed on a per-control basis.
 </para>
 <para>
  In the input model, each region is defined as a set of services drawn from
  one or more control-planes. All of the following are valid mappings of
  control-planes to regions:

 <para>
  In a simple single control-plane cloud, there is no need for a separate
  region definition and the control-plane itself can define the region name.
