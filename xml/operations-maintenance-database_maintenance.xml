    Heat-manage helps manage Heat specific database operations. The associated
    database should be periodically purged to save space. The following should
    be setup as a cron job on the servers where the heat service is running at
    <literal>/etc/cron.weekly/local-cleanup-heat</literal>
    with the following content:
  </para>
  <screen>
  #!/bin/bash
  su heat -s /bin/bash -c "/usr/bin/heat-manage purge_deleted -g days 14" || :
  </screen>
  <para>
     nova-manage db archive_deleted_rows command will move deleted rows
     from production tables to shadow tables. Including
     <literal>--until-complete</literal> will make the command run continuously
     until all deleted rows are archived. It is recommended to setup this task
     as <literal>/etc/cron.weekly/local-cleanup-nova</literal>
     on the servers where the nova service is running, with the
     following content:
  </para>
  <screen>
  #!/bin/bash
  su nova -s /bin/bash -c "/usr/bin/nova-manage db archive_deleted_rows --until-complete" || :
