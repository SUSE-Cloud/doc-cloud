    <para>When a <guilabel>server</guilabel> has more than a single physical network port, a
        <guilabel>nic-mapping</guilabel> is required to unambiguously identify each port.
        Standard Linux mapping of ports to interface names at the time of initial discovery (e.g.
        eth0, eth1, eth2, ...) is not uniformly consistent from server to server, so a mapping of PCI
        bus address to interface name is instead.</para>

    
        
        <para>NIC mappings are also used to specify the device type for interfaces that are to be used for SR-IOV 
            or PCI Passthrough.   Each [[[kw-hos]]] release includes the data for the supported device types.</para>
