 <title>Log File Handling</title>
 <para>
  In case of trouble with the <phrase>CMM</phrase> services, you can study
  their log files to find the reason. The log files are also useful if you need
  to contact your support organization. For storing the log files, the default
  installation uses the <literal>/var/log</literal> directory on the hosts
  where the agents or services are installed.
 </para>
 <para>
  You can use <literal>systemd</literal>, a system and session manager for
  LINUX, and <literal>journald</literal>, a LINUX logging interface, for
  addressing dispersed log files.
 </para>
 <para>
  The <phrase>CMM</phrase> installer automatically puts all
  <phrase>CMM</phrase> services under the control of
  <literal>systemd</literal>. <literal>journald</literal> provides a
  centralized management solution for the logging of all processes that are
  controlled by <literal>systemd</literal>. The logs are collected and managed
  in a so-called journal controlled by the <literal>journald</literal> daemon.
