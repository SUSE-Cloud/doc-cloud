  <emphasis>A <guimenu>control-plane</guimenu> runs one or more
  <guimenu>services</guimenu>.</emphasis>

 <para>
  A service is the collection of <guimenu>service-components</guimenu> that
  provide a particular feature; for example, Nova provides the compute service
  and consists of the following service-components: nova-api, nova-scheduler,
  nova-conductor, nova-novncproxy, and nova-compute. Some services, like the
  authentication/identity service Keystone, only consist of a single
  service-component.
 </para>
 <para>
  To define your cloud, all you need to know about a service are the names of
  the <guimenu>service-components</guimenu>. The details of the services
  themselves and how they interact with each other is captured in service
  definition files provided by &kw-hos;.
 </para>
 <para>
  When specifying your &kw-hos; cloud you have to decide where components will
  run and how they connect to the networks. For example, should they all run in
  one <guimenu>control-plane</guimenu> sharing common services or be
  distributed across multiple <guimenu>control-planes</guimenu> to provide
  separate instances of some services? The &kw-hos; supplied examples provide
  solutions for some typical configurations.
 </para>
 <para>
  Where services run is defined in the <guimenu>control-plane</guimenu>. How
  they connect to networks is defined in the <guimenu>network-groups</guimenu>.
