    <para>
        <emphasis>A <guimenu>control-plane</guimenu> runs one or more
            <guimenu>services</guimenu>.</emphasis>
    </para>

    <para>A service is the collection of <guimenu>service-components</guimenu> that provide a
        particular feature; for example, Nova provides the compute service and consists of the
        following service-components: nova-api, nova-scheduler, nova-conductor, nova-novncproxy, and
        nova-compute. Some services, like the authentication/identity service Keystone, only consist
        of a single service-component.</para>

    <para>To define your cloud, all you need to know about a service are the names of the
            <guimenu>service-components</guimenu>. The details of the services themselves and how
        they interact with each other is captured in service definition files provided by
        &kw-hos;.</para>

    <para>When specifying your &kw-hos; cloud you have to decide where components will run and
        how they connect to the networks. For example, should they all run in one
            <guimenu>control-plane</guimenu> sharing common services or be distributed across
        multiple <guimenu>control-planes</guimenu> to provide separate instances of some services?
        The &kw-hos; supplied examples provide solutions for some typical configurations.</para>

    <para>Where services run is defined in the <guimenu>control-plane</guimenu>. How they connect to
        networks is defined in the <guimenu>network-groups</guimenu>.</para>
