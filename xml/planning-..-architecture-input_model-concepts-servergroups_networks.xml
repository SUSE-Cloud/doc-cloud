    <para>Each L3 <guilabel>network</guilabel> in a cloud must be associated with all or some of
        the <guilabel>servers</guilabel>, typically following a physical pattern (such as having
        separate networks for each rack or set of racks). This is also represented in the
        [[[kw-hos]]] model via <guilabel>server-groups</guilabel>, each group lists zero or more
        networks to which <guilabel>servers</guilabel> associated with
        <guilabel>server-groups</guilabel> at or below this point in the hierarchy are
        connected.</para>

    <para>When the configuration processor needs to resolve the specific
        <guilabel>network</guilabel> a <guilabel>server</guilabel> should be configured to
        use, it traverses up the hierarchy of <guilabel>server-groups</guilabel>, starting with
        the group the server is directly associated with, until it finds a server-group that lists a
        network in the required network group.</para>

    <para>The level in the <guilabel>server-group</guilabel> hierarchy at which a
        <guilabel>network</guilabel> is associated will depend on the span of connectivity it
        must provide. In the above example there might be networks in some
        <guilabel>network-groups</guilabel> which are per rack (i.e. Rack 1 and Rack 2 list
        different networks from the same <guilabel>network-group</guilabel>) and
        <guilabel>networks</guilabel> in a different <guilabel>network-group</guilabel> that
        span failure zones (the network used to provide floating IP addresses to virtual machines
        for example).</para>
