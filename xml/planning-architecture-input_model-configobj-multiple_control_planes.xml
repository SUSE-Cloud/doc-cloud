 <title>Multiple Control Planes</title>
 <para>
  The dependencies between service components (for example, Nova needs
  &mariadb; and Keystone API) is defined as part of the service definitions
  provide by &productname;, the control-planes define how those dependencies will
  be met. For clouds consisting of multiple control-planes, the relationship
  between services in different control planes is defined by a
  <literal>uses</literal> attribute in its control-plane object. Services
  will always use other services in the same control-plane before looking to
  see if the required service can be provided from another control-plane.
  For example, a service component in control-plane
  <literal>cp-2</literal> (for example, nova-api) might use service
  components from control-plane <literal>cp-shared</literal> (for example,
  keystone-api).
