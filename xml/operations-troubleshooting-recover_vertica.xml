  In &kw-hos-phrase;, the monitoring service uses Vertica as its database. If
  it is configured incorrectly, or if a higher than expected load is
  experienced, and the file system fills up then Vertica may fall over and need

  In &kw-hos-phrase;, the monitoring service uses Vertica as its database. If
  it is configured incorrectly, or if a higher than expected load is
  experienced, and the file system fills up then Vertica may fall over and need
  to be recreated. In these cases you will need to recreate the Vertica
  database as described below.

 <para>
  Prior to getting to that point you may see the <literal>Disk Usage</literal>
  alarm trigger, which is a sign that the file system is filling up. If you can
  resolve this issue quickly using the steps below then you can prevent the
  Vertica database failure.

  <title>Changing the Vertica retention period</title>
  <para>
   If the <literal>Disk Usage</literal> alarm has triggered against the
   <literal>mount_point: /var/vertica</literal> and the Vertica database and
   API is still up, you can change the retention period using the steps below
   while you resolve the issue:

    <para>
     Log in to the &lcm;.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Edit the configuration file noted below to edit the retention period.
    </para>
    <para>
     The configuration file to edit is:
    </para>
<screen>~/openstack/my_cloud/config/monasca/configuration.yml</screen>
    <para>
     Change the <literal>vertica_retention_period</literal> value to the number
     of days you want to hold Monasca data in Vertica. If your Vertica file
     system just filled up, or is close to doing so, make sure you are lowering
     it to a value less than the amount of days it took to fill in the first
     place.
    </para>
    <para>
     The section looks like this, bolded for emphasis:

kafka_low_disk_retention: 1800000 # 30 minutes in milliseconds

    <para>
     From your first controller node (which may be your &lcm;),
     manually run the newly created Vertica cleanup cronjob:

   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     At this point your Vertica database should be recreated. You may want to
     consider lowering the retention period if this was the source of the
     problem. Details can be found here: <xref linkend="changing_retention"/>.
