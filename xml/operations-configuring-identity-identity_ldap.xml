 <title>Integrating LDAP with the Identity Service</title>

  <title>Integrating with an external LDAP server</title>
  <para>
   The Keystone identity service provides two primary functions: user
   authentication and access authorization. The user authentication function
   validates a user's identity. Keystone has a very basic user management
   system that can be used to create and manage user login and password
   credentials but this system is intended only for proof of concept
   deployments due to the very limited password control functions. The internal
   identity service user management system is also commonly used to store and
   authenticate OpenStack-specific service account information.
  </para>
  <para>
   The recommended source of authentication is external user management systems
   such as LDAP directory services. The identity service can be configured to
   connect to and use external systems as the source of user authentication.
   The identity service domain construct is used to define different
   authentication sources based on domain membership. For example, cloud
   deployment could consist of as few as two domains:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist xml:id="ul_msq_q3h_4v">
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The default domain that is pre-configured for the service account users
     that are authenticated directly against the identity service internal user
     management system
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     A customer-defined domain that contains all user projects and membership
     definitions. This domain can then be configured to use an external LDAP
     directory such as Microsoft Active Directory as the authentication source.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>
   &kw-hos; can support multiple domains for deployments that support multiple
   tenants. Multiple domains can be created with each domain configured to
   either the same or different external authentication sources. This
   deployment model is known as a "per-domain" model.
  </para>
  <para>
   There are currently two ways to configure "per-domain" authentication
   sources:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist xml:id="ul_nsq_q3h_4v">
   <listitem>
    <para>
     File store – each domain configuration is created and stored in separate
     text files. This is the older and current default method for defining
     domain configurations.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Database store – each domain configuration can be created using either
     the identity service manager utility (recommenced) or a
     <link xlink:href="http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref-identity-v3.html#domains-config-v3">Domain
     Admin API</link> (from OpenStack.org), and the results are stored in the
     identity service &mariadb; database. This database store is a new method
     introduced in the OpenStack Kilo release and now available in
     &kw-hos;.
    </para>
   </listitem>

   Instructions for initially creating per-domain configuration files and then
   migrating to the Database store method via the identity service manager
   utility are provided as follows.

    When integrating with an external identity provider, cloud security is
    dependent upon the security of that identify provider. You should examine
    the security of the identity provider, and in particular the SAML 2.0 token
    generation process and decide what security properties you need to ensure
    adequate security of your cloud deployment. More information about SAML can
    be found at
