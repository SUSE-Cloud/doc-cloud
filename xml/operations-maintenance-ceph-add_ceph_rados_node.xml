 <title>Adding a RADOS Gateway Node</title>
 <para>
  During your initial installation and deployment, if you defined a dedicated
  cluster for the Ceph RADOS gateway component then these steps can be used to
  add additional Ceph RADOS gateway nodes.
 </para>
 <para>
  You can install RADOS Gateway service in either of the following modes:

  <listitem>
   <para>
    On dedicated cluster nodes (default)
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    On (dedicated) cluster node(s) that host Ceph Monitor service
   </para>

   <para>
    On controller nodes
   </para>
  </listitem>

 <section>
  <title>Prerequisite</title>
  <para>
   You should have one or more bare-metal servers that meet the minimum hardware
   requirements for a RADOS gateway node which are documented in the

  <title>Adding a RADOS Gateway Node on Dedicated Cluster Nodes</title>
  <para>
   When RADOS Gateway is installed in this mode, a new RADOS Gateway node can
   be added to the Ceph cluster by executing the steps outlined in
   <xref linkend="procedure-to-add-rgw-node"/>.

  <title>Adding a RADOS Gateway Node On (Dedicated) Cluster Node(s) that Host Ceph Monitor Service</title>
  <para>
   When RADOS Gateway is installed in this mode, it is co-hosted with Ceph
   Monitor, adding a new RADOS Gateway node will also result in addition of a
   Ceph Monitor (which will violate the recommendation of maintaining odd
   number of monitors in a cluster). Therefore, in this mode it is recommended
   to add 2 nodes of this type at a time. Perform the steps outlined in
   <xref linkend="procedure-to-add-rgw-node"/>.

   When RADOS Gateway is already installed in this mode, a new RADOS Gateway
   node cannot be added to an existing Ceph cluster.

   Perform the following procedure to add RADOS Gateway Node:

     Log in to your lifecycle manager.

   <step>
    <para>
     Edit your input model
     <literal>~/helion/my_cloud/definition/data/servers.yml</literal> file to
     include the Ceph RADOS Gateway nodes. Copy and paste the section for an
     existing server having the RGW-ROLE role (if on dedicated cluster node) or
     MON-ROLE (if co-hosted on a Monitor cluster node) and edit the values to
     match the new server being added.
    </para>
    <!-- FIXME: comment from DITA original: -->
    <!-- Can you provide an example? -->
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Verify the <literal>control_plane.yml</literal> file to check the values
     for member-count, min-count, and max-count, if you specified them, to
     ensure that they match up with your new total node count. For example, if
     you had previously specified member-count: 3 and are adding a fourth Ceph
     RADOS Gateway node, you will need to change that value to member-count: 4.
