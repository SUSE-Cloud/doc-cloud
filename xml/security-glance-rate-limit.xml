 <title>&o_img;-API Rate Limit (CVE-2016-8611)</title>
 <para>
  Within the &o_img; service, calls to the POST method within v1 or v2/images
  creates records in <literal>queued</literal> status. No limit is enforced
  within the &o_img; API on the number of images a single tenant may
  create. The only limit is on the total amount of storage a single user may
  consume. More information about this vulnerability is at <link
  xlink:href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-8611"/>
 </para>
 <para>
  Therefore a user could maliciously or unintentionally fill multiple database
  tables (images, image_properties, image_tags, image_members) with useless
  image records, thereby causing a denial of service by lengthening transaction
  response times in the &o_img; database.
 </para>
 <para>
  This issue can be mitigated with a rate limiter to the glance-api haproxy
  endpoints. Only POST requests are affected. Instance launch is not impacted.
  The number of images that can be created in a 60 minute window is limited.
  The default value is 600 connections per 60 minute window which should cover
  most normal glance-api use cases. When the number of connections has been
  exceeded, the user is locked out for the duration of the 60 minute
  interval. The value for the number of connections per 60 minute period can be
  overridden by editing the <filename>control_plane.yml</filename> file.
 </para>
 <para>
  The following steps will implement the rate limiter patch.
 </para>
 <procedure>
  <step>
   <para>
    Edit <filename>control_plane.yml</filename>, adding the following glance_rate_limit
    entry. Change the <literal>glance_rate_limit</literal> if the default 600 connections does not
    fit your situation.
