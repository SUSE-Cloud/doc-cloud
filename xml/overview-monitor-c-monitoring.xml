 <title>Monitoring</title>
 <para id="The_monitoring_solution_of_concept_conbody_section_1_p">
  The monitoring solution of <phrase>CMM</phrase> addresses the requirements of
  large-scale public and private clouds where high numbers of physical and
  virtual servers need to be monitored and huge amounts of monitoring data need
  to be managed. <phrase>CMM</phrase> consolidates metrics, alarms, and
  notifications, as well as health and status information from multiple
  systems, thus reducing the complexity and allowing for a higher level
  analysis of the monitoring data.

  The <emphasis role="bold">Monitoring Service operator</emphasis> is
  responsible for providing the monitoring features to the application
  operators and the OpenStack operator. This enables the application operators
  and the OpenStack operator to focus on operation and ensure the quality of
  their services without having to carry out the tedious tasks implied by
  setting up and administrating their own system monitoring software. The
  Monitoring Service operator uses the features himself for monitoring the
  operation of <phrase>CMM</phrase>.

  <emphasis role="bold">Application operators</emphasis> monitor the virtual

  ensure that the physical and virtual servers on which their services are
  provided are up and running as required.
 </para>
 <para id="TheOS_concept_conbody_section_2_p">
  The <emphasis role="bold">OpenStack operator</emphasis> monitors physical and
  virtual servers, hypervisors, and services of the underlying platform. In
  addition, he is responsible for the middleware components, for example, the
  database services.
 </para>
 <bridgehead renderas="sect4">Metrics</bridgehead>
 <para>
  A Metrics Agent can be installed and configured on each physical and virtual
  server where cloud resources are to be monitored. The agent is responsible
  for querying metrics and sending the data to the Monitoring Service for
  further processing.
 </para>
 <para id="Metrics_represent_self-descri_concept_conbody_section_3_p">
  Metrics are self-describing data structures that are uniquely identified by a
  name and a set of dimensions. Each dimension consists of a key/value pair
  that allows for a flexible and concise description of the data to be
  monitored, for example, region, availability zone, service tier, or resource
  ID.
 </para>
 <para id="idg-overview-monitor-c-monitoring-xml-15">
  The Metrics Agent supports various types of metrics including the following:
 </para>
 <itemizedlist id="System_metrics_for_example_concept_conbody_section_3_ul">
  <listitem>
   <para>
    System metrics, for example, CPU usage, consumed disk space, or network
    traffic.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Host alive checks. The agent can perform active checks on a host to
    determine whether it is alive using ping (ICMP) or SSH.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Process checks. The agent can check and monitor a process, for example, the
    number of instances, memory size, or number of threads.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    HTTP endpoint checks. The agent can perform up/down checks on HTTP
    endpoints by sending an HTTP request and reporting success or failure to
    the Monitoring Service.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Service checks. The agent can check middleware services, for example,
    MySQL, Kafka, or RabbitMQ.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    OpenStack services. The agent can perform specific checks on each process
    that is part of an OpenStack service.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Log metrics. The agent can check and monitor the number of critical log
    entries in the log data retrieved from the cloud resources.

 <bridgehead renderas="sect4">Data Visualization and Analysis</bridgehead>
 <para>
  All <phrase>CMM</phrase> user groups work with a graphical user interface
  that is seamlessly integrated into their cloud infrastructure. <phrase>Based
  on OpenStack Horizon, the user interface enables access to all monitoring
  functionality and the resulting large-scale monitoring data.</phrase>
 </para>
 <para id="A_comfortable_dashboard_visua_concept_conbody_section_4_p">
  A comfortable dashboard visualizes the health and status of the cloud
  resources. It allows <phrase>CMM</phrase> users to experiment with many ways
  of analyzing the performance of their cloud resources in real-time. They
  cannot only view but also share and explore visualizations of their
  monitoring data.
 </para>
 <bridgehead renderas="sect4">Alarms and Notifications</bridgehead>
 <para>
  <phrase>CMM</phrase> supports GUI-based alarm and notification management.
  <phrase>Template-based alarm definitions allow for monitoring a dynamically
  changing set of resources without the need for reconfiguration. While the
  number of underlying virtual machines is changing, for example, this ensures
  the efficient monitoring of scalable cloud services. Alarm definitions allow
  you to specify expressions that are evaluated based on the metrics data that
  is received. Alarm definitions can be combined to form compound alarms.
  Compound alarms allow you to track and process even more complex events.
  Notifications can be configured in order to inform <phrase>CMM</phrase> users
  when an alarm is triggered.</phrase>
