  services and servers. They include system checks, for example, on CPU usage,
  disk space, or the average system load. No manual configuration is required
  for these system checks. The installer automatically configures them to
  retrieve monitoring data from the server where your agent is installed. For
  details on these metrics, refer to
  <xref linkend="idg-osoperator-shared-appendix-r-metricsstandard-xml-1"/>.
 </para>
