 <title>&kw-hos-tm;: Service Admin Role Segregation in the Identity Service</title>
 <section xml:id="idg-all-security-admin_role_segregation-xml-6">
  <title>Overview</title>
  <para>
   Under the default &ostack; user policies, a user can have either member
   privilege or admin privilege. Admin privilege is assigned by creating a user
   account with the role of admin. However, the default admin role is too broad
   and often grants users more privilege than they need, giving them access to
   additional tasks and resources that they shouldn't have.
  </para>
  <para>
   Ideally, each user account should only be assigned privileges necessary to
   perform tasks they are required to perform. According to the widely accepted
   principle of least privilege, a user who needs to perform administrative
   tasks should have a user account with the privileges required to perform
   only those administrative tasks and no others. This prevents the granting of
   too much privilege while retaining the individual accountability of the
   user.
  </para>
  <para>
   Service Administrator Roles is an alternative to the current
   one-size-fits-all admin role model and can help you institute different
   privileges for different administrators.

  <title>Roles</title>
  <para>
   The following are the roles defined in &kw-hos-phrase;. These roles serve as
   a way to group common administrative needs at the &ostack; service level.
   Each role represents administrative privilege into each service. Multiple
   roles can be assigned to a user. You can assign a Service Admin Role to a
   user once you have determined that the user is authorized to perform
   administrative actions and access resources in that service.
