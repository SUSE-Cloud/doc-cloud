 <title>Configuring Load Balancing as a Service (LBaaS)</title>
 <para>
  <emphasis role="bold">&kw-hos-phrase; LBaaS Configuration</emphasis>
 </para>
 <para>
  Load Balancing as a Service (LBaaS) is an advanced networking service that
  allows load balancing of multi-node environments. It provides the ability to
  spread requests across multiple servers thereby reducing the load on any
  single server. This document describes the installation steps for LBaaS v1
  (see prerequisites) and the configuration for LBaaS v1 and v2.
 </para>
 <para>
  &kw-hos-phrase; can support either LBaaS v1 or LBaaS v2 to allow for wide
  ranging customer requirements. If the decision is made to utilize LBaaS v1 it
  is highly unlikely that you will be able to perform an on-line upgrade of the
  service to v2 after the fact as the internal data structures are
  significantly different. Should you wish to attempt an upgrade support will
  be needed from Helion Professional Services and your chosen load balancer
  partner.
 </para>
 <warning>
  <para>
   The LBaaS architecture is based on a driver model to support different load
   balancers. LBaaS-compatible drivers are provided by load balancer vendors
   including F5 and Citrix. A new software load balancer driver was introduced
   in the OpenStack Liberty release called "<emphasis>Octavia</emphasis>". The
   Octavia driver deploys a software load balancer called HAProxy. Octavia is
   the default load balancing provider in &kw-hos-phrase; for LBaaS V2.
   <!-- FIXME: Removed version number 3.0 from product name above. Still
   correct? - sknorr, 2018-03-27 -->
   Until Octavia is configured the creation of load balancers will fail with an
   error. Please refer to <xref linkend="OctaviaInstall"/> document for
   information on installing Octavia.
  </para>
 </warning>
 <warning>
  <para>
   Before upgrading to &productname; &productnumber;, contact F5 and
   &vendor; to determine which F5 drivers have been certified for use with
   &productname;. Loading drivers not certified by &vendor; may result in
   failure of your cloud deployment.
  </para>

 <para>
  LBaaS V2 offers with <xref linkend="OctaviaInstall"/> a software load
  balancing solution that supports both a highly available control plane and
  data plane. However, should an external hardware load balancer be selected
  the cloud operation can achieve additional performance and availability.

<!-- Commented in DITA original -->
<!-- Original note from Tim Cuddy 
<note>Neither LBaaS API currently supports load balancer failover. If a load balancer is deleted
it will need to be manually recreated. Future releases of the v2 API are targeted to include
automatic failover of a deployed load balancer. This functionality is targeted for the
OpenStack Mitaka release via the Octavia software driver. More information about this driver
can be found at: <xref href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8n7FGhtOiXk" format="html"
