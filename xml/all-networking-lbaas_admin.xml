    (LBaaS)</title>
    <!---->


    <para><emphasis role="bold">&kw-hos-phrase; LBaaS Configuration</emphasis></para>

    <para> Load Balancing as a Service (LBaaS) is an advanced networking service that allows load
      balancing of multi-node environments. It provides the ability to spread requests across
      multiple servers thereby reducing the load on any single server. This document describes the
      installation steps for LBaaS v1 (see prerequisites) and the configuration for LBaaS v1 and
      v2.</para>


    <para>&kw-hos-phrase; can support either LBaaS v1 or LBaaS v2 to allow for wide
      ranging customer requirements. If the decision is made to utilize LBaaS v1 it is highly
      unlikely that you will be able to perform an on-line upgrade of the service to v2 after the
      fact as the internal data structures are significantly different. Should you wish to attempt
      an upgrade support will be needed from Helion Professional Services and your chosen load
      balancer partner.</para>


    <warning><para>The LBaaS architecture is based on a driver model to support different load
      balancers. LBaaS-compatible drivers are provided by load balancer vendors including F5 and
      Citrix. A new software load balancer driver was introduced in the OpenStack Liberty release
      called "<emphasis>Octavia</emphasis>". The Octavia driver deploys a software load balancer called HAProxy.
      Octavia is the default load balancing provider in &kw-hos-phrase-30; for
      LBaaS V2. Until Octavia is configured the creation of load balancers will fail with an error.
      Please refer to <xref linkend="OctaviaInstall"/>
      document for information on installing Octavia.</para>
</warning>

    <warning><para>If you are planning to upgrade from &kw-hos-phrase-30; or &kw-hos-phrase-40;,
      please contact F5 and HPE PointNext to determine which F5 drivers have been certified for
      use with Helion OpenStack. Loading drivers not certified by HPE may result in catastrophic
      failure of your cloud deployment. The last tested versions are 8.0.8 for &kw-hos; 3.x and 9.0.3
      for &kw-hos; 4.x . More information is expected in 4th quarter 2017, including the correct
      drivers for &kw-hos; 5.x.</para>
</warning>

    <para>LBaaS V2 offers with <xref linkend="OctaviaInstall"/> a
      software load balancing solution that supports both a highly available control plane and data
      plane. However, should an external hardware load balancer be selected the cloud operation can
      achieve additional performance and availability.</para>
