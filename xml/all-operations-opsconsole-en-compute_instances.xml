        <sidebar><title>Search and Sort</title><para>The search bar allows you to filter the alarm definitions you want to view. Type and
                Status are examples of alarm criteria that can be specified. Additionally, you can
                filter by typing in text similar to searching by keywords.</para>
<para>The checkbox allows you to select (or deselect) a group of alarm definitions to
                delete:</para>
