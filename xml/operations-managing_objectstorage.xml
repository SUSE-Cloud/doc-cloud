 <title>Managing Object Storage</title>
 <para>
  Information about managing and configuring the Object Storage service.
 </para>
 <para>
  The Object Storage service may be deployed in a full-fledged manner, with
  proxy nodes engaging rings for managing the accounts, containers,
  and objects being stored. Or, it may simply be deployed as a front-end to
  &ses;, offering Object Storage APIs with an external back-end.
 </para>
 <para>
  In the former case, managing your Object Storage environment includes tasks
  related to ensuring your &swift; rings stay balanced, and that and other
  topics are discussed in more detail in this section. &swift; includes many
  commands and utilities for these purposes.
 </para>
 <para>
  When used as a front-end to &ses;, many &swift; constructs such as rings
  and ring balancing, replica dispersion, etc. do not apply, as &swift; itself
  is not responsible for the mechanics of object storage.
