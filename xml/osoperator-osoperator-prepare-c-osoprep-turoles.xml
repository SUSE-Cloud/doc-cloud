 <title>Creating a Role and a User Account in OpenStack</title>
 <para>
  As a prerequisite for installing a Metrics Agent, you need to take the
  following preparations.
 </para>
 <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Create the <literal>monitoring-delegate</literal> role in OpenStack
    Keystone.
   </para>
   <para>
    This role is required for cross-tenant metrics submission. A application
    operator who has booked a virtual machine must receive only the monitoring
    data related to his virtual machine. This role enables the agent to submit
    metrics on behalf of an individual application operator.
   </para>
   <para>
    Example command for creating the <literal>monitoring-delegate</literal>
    role:
   </para>
<screen>$ openstack role create monitoring-delegate </screen>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Create a new user account for configuring the agent, or use the
    <literal>admin-agent</literal> user that has already been created during
    the installation of the OpenStack extensions. Assign the
    <literal>monitoring-delegate</literal> role to the user.
   </para>
   <para>
    The user name and password must be specified in the agent configuration
    when the agent is installed. It is recommended that this user account is
    used only for configuration purposes and not for actually monitoring the
    services.
   </para>
   <para>
    Example command for assigning the <literal>monitoring-delegate</literal>
    role to the <literal>admin-agent</literal> user:
   </para>
<screen>$ openstack role add --project admin --user admin-agent monitoring-delegate </screen>
  </listitem>
