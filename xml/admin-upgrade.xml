    <title>Upgrade from Newton to Ocata</title>
    <para>The <literal>barbican-api-paste.ini</literal> configuration file for the paste pipeline was
                updated to add the <literal>http_proxy_to_wsgi</literal> middleware. It can be used to help
                barbican respond with the correct URL refs when itâ€™s put behind a TLS proxy
                (such as HAProxy). This middleware is disabled by default, but can be enabled
                via a configuration option in the <literal>oslo_middleware</literal> group.</para>

    <title>Upgrade from Liberty to Mitaka</title>
    <para>The Metadata API requires an update to the Database Schema. Existing
                deployments that are being upgraded to Mitaka should use the <literal>barbican-manage</literal>
                utility to update the schema.</para>
    <para>If you are upgrading from previous version of barbican that uses the PKCS#11
                Cryptographic Plugin driver, you will need to run the migration script.</para>
