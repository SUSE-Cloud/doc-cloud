 <title>Installing the Command-Line Clients</title>
 <para>
  During the installation, by default, the suite of OpenStack command-line
  tools are installed on the &clm; and the control plane in your
  environment. You can learn more about these in the OpenStack
  documentation here:
  <link xlink:href="https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/latest/">OpenStackClient</link>.
 </para>
 <para>
  If you wish to install the command-line interfaces on other nodes in your
  environment, there are two methods you can use to do so that we describe
  below.
 </para>
 <section xml:id="idg-all-userguide-installing-cli-xml-5">
  <title>Installing the CLI tools using the input model</title>
  <para>
   During the initial install phase of your cloud you can edit your input model
   to request that the command-line clients be installed on any of the node
   clusters in your environment. To do so, follow these steps:
  </para>
  <procedure>
   <step>
    <para>
     Log in to the &clm;.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Edit your <literal>control_plane.yml</literal> file. Full path:
    </para>
<screen>~/openstack/my_cloud/definition/data/control_plane.yml</screen>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     In this file you will see a list of <literal>service-components</literal>
     to be installed on each of your clusters. These clusters will be divided
     per role, with your controller node cluster likely coming at the
     beginning. Here you will see a list of each of the clients that can be
     installed. These include:
    </para>
<screen>keystone-client
glance-client
cinder-client
nova-client
neutron-client
swift-client
heat-client
openstack-client
monasca-client
barbican-client
designate-client</screen>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     For each client you want to install, specify the name under the
     <literal>service-components</literal> section for the cluster you want to
     install it on.
    </para>
    <para>
     So, for example, if you would like to install the nova and neutron clients on
     your Compute node cluster, you can do so by adding the
     <literal>nova-client</literal> and <literal>neutron-client</literal>
     services, like this:
    </para>
<screen>      resources:
        - name: compute
          resource-prefix: comp
          server-role: COMPUTE-ROLE
          allocation-policy: any
          min-count: 0
          service-components:
            - ntp-client
            - nova-compute
            - nova-compute-kvm
            - neutron-l3-agent
            - neutron-metadata-agent
            - neutron-openvswitch-agent
            <emphasis role="bold">- nova-client
            - neutron-client</emphasis></screen>
    <note>
     <para>
      This example uses the <literal>entry-scale-kvm</literal> sample
      file. Your model may be different so use this as a guide but do not
      copy and paste the contents of this example into your input model.
     </para>
    </note>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Commit your configuration to the local git repo, as follows:
    </para>
<screen>cd ~/openstack/ardana/ansible
git add -A
git commit -m "My config or other commit message"</screen>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Continue with the rest of your installation.
    </para>
   </step>
  </procedure>

  <title>Installing the CLI tools using Ansible</title>
  <para>
   At any point after your initial installation you can install the
   command-line clients on any of the nodes in your environment. To do so,
   follow these steps:
  </para>
  <orderedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Log in to the &clm;.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Obtain the hostname for the nodes you want to install the clients on by
     looking in your hosts file:
    </para>
<screen>cat /etc/hosts</screen>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Install the clients using this playbook, specifying your hostnames using
     commas:
    </para>
<screen>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/ardana/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts -e "install_package=&lt;client_name&gt;" client-deploy.yml -e "install_hosts=&lt;hostname&gt;"</screen>
    <para>
     So, for example, if you would like to install the novaClient on two of your
     Compute nodes with hostnames <literal>ardana-cp1-comp0001-mgmt</literal>
     and <literal>ardana-cp1-comp0002-mgmt</literal> you can use this syntax:
    </para>
<screen>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/ardana/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts -e "install_package=novaclient" client-deploy.yml -e "install_hosts=ardana-cp1-comp0001-mgmt,ardana-cp1-comp0002-mgmt"</screen>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Once the playbook completes successfully, you should be able to SSH to
     those nodes and, using the proper credentials, authenticate and use the
     command-line interfaces you have installed.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </orderedlist>
