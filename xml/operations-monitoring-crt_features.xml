 <title>Monasca Transform Features</title>
 <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Monasca Transform is a new component in Monasca which transforms and
    aggregates metrics using Apache Spark
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Aggregated metrics are published to Kafka and are available for other
    monasca components like monasca-threshold and are stored in monasca
    datastore
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Cloud operators can set thresholds and set alarms to receive notifications
    when thresholds are met.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    These aggregated metrics are made available to the cloud operators via
    &opscon;'s new Capacity Summary (reporting) UI
   </para>

  <listitem>
   <para>
    Capacity reporting is a new feature in &kw-hos; which will provides
    cloud operators an overall capacity (available, used and remaining) for
    Compute and Object Storage
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Cloud operators can look at Capacity reporting via &opscon;'s Compute
    Capacity Summary and Object Storage Capacity Summary UI
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Capacity reporting allows the cloud operators the ability to ensure that
    cloud resource pools have sufficient capacity to meet demands of users. See
    table below for Service and Capacity Types.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    A list of aggregated metrics is provided in
    <xref linkend="crt-aggregated-metrics"/>.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Capacity reporting aggregated metrics are aggregated and published every
    hour
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    In addition to the overall capacity, there are graphs which show the
    capacity trends over time range (for 1 day, for 7 days, for 30 days or for
    45 days)
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Graphs showing the capacity trends by a particular project or compute host
    are also provided.
