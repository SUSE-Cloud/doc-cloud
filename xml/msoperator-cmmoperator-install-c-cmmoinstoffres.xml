    The installer uses Ansible group variables for configuration purposes. The
    group variables are located in the
    <literal>/opt/FJSVsvcmm/group_vars</literal> directory. The
    <literal>offline_group</literal> file defines the default configuration. No
    changes are required.
   </para>
   <note>
    <para>
     Make changes only if you have to deviate from the default.
    </para>
   </note>
   <para>
    To view the default configuration, you can open the file with your favorite
    editor.
   </para>
   <para>
    Example:
   </para>
<screen>sudo vim /opt/FJSVsvcmm/group_vars/offline_group</screen>

  <listitem>
   <para>
    To install the offline resources, execute the following command:
   </para>
<screen>ansible-playbook /opt/FJSVsvcmm/offline.yml</screen>
   <para>
    The following response is displayed if the installation is successful.
   </para>
   <para>
    Example:
   </para>
<screen>PLAY RECAP ********************************************************
offline-resources-host : ok=40  changed=23  unreachable=0  failed=0</screen>
   <note>
    <para>
     There are checks performed during installation that may result in failures
     or warnings. These failures and warnings are reported but they do not
     block the installation. It is only this final message that is relevant for
     a successful installation.
    </para>
   </note>
   <para>
    In case the installation fails, retry it in verbose mode. To collect debug
    information, you can execute the following command:
   </para>
<screen>ansible-playbook -vvvv /opt/FJSVsvcmm/offline.yml</screen>
  </listitem>
 </orderedlist>
 <para>
  As soon as the offline resources are successfully installed, the OpenStack
  operator must prepare the OpenStack platform for <phrase>SUSE OpenStack Cloud
  Monitoring</phrase>. Refer to the <emphasis>OpenStack Operator's
  Guide</emphasis> for details on the tasks of the OpenStack operator. He
  installs the required OpenStack extensions and creates the users and roles in
  OpenStack required for installing and working with <phrase>SUSE OpenStack
  Cloud Monitoring</phrase>.
 </para>
 <para>
  Before proceeding with the installation of the Monitoring Service, contact
  your OpenStack operator and make the corresponding arrangements.
