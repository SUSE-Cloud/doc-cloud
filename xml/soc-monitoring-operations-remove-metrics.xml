 <title>Removing Metrics Data</title>
 <para>
  Metrics data is stored in the Metrics and Alarms InfluxDB Database. InfluxDB
  features an SQL-like query language for querying data and performing
  aggregations on that data.
 </para>
 <para>
  The Metrics Agent configuration defines the metrics and types of measurement
  for which data is stored. For each measurement, a so-called series is written
  to the InfluxDB database. A series consists of a timestamp, the metrics, and
  the value measured.
 </para>
 <para>
  Every series can be assigned key tags. In the case of <phrase>SUSE OpenStack
  Cloud Monitoring</phrase>, this is the <literal>_tenant_id</literal> tag.
  This tag identifies the OpenStack project for which the metrics data has been
  collected.
 </para>
 <para>
  From time to time, you may want to delete outdated or unnecessary metrics
  data from the Metrics and Alarms Database, for example, to save space or
  remove data for metrics you are no longer interested in. To delete data, you
  use the InfluxDB command line interface, the interactive shell that is
  provided for the InfluxDB database.
 </para>
 <para>
  Proceed as follows to delete metrics data from the database:
 </para>
 <orderedlist>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Create a backup of the database.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Determine the ID of the OpenStack project for the data to be deleted:
   </para>
   <para>
    Log in to the OpenStack dashboard and go to <emphasis role="bold">Identity
    &gt; Projects</emphasis>. The <literal>monasca</literal> project initially
    provides all metrics data related to <phrase>SUSE OpenStack Cloud
    Monitoring</phrase>.
   </para>
   <para>
    In the course of the productive operation of <phrase>SUSE OpenStack Cloud
    Monitoring</phrase>, additional projects may be created, for example, for
    application operators.
   </para>
   <para>
    The <emphasis role="bold">Project ID</emphasis> field shows the relevant
    tenant ID.
   </para>

   <para>
    Log in to the host where the Monitoring Service is installed.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Go to the directory where InfluxDB is installed:
   </para>
<screen>cd /usr/bin</screen>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Connect to InfluxDB using the InfluxDB command line interface as follows:
   </para>
<screen>./influx -host &lt;host_ip&gt;</screen>
   <para>
    Replace <literal>&lt;host_ip&gt;</literal> with the IP address of the
    machine on which <phrase>SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</phrase> is
    installed.
   </para>
   <para>
    The output of this command is, for example, as follows:
   </para>
<screen>Connected to http://localhost:8086 version 1.1.1
InfluxDB shell version: 1.1.1
</screen>
  </listitem>

     <para>
      You can view all measurements for a specific project as follows:
     </para>
<screen>SHOW MEASUREMENTS WHERE _tenant_id = '&lt;project ID&gt;'</screen>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      You can view the series for a specific metrics and project, for example,
      as follows:
     </para>
<screen>SHOW SERIES FROM "cpu.user_perc" WHERE _tenant_id = '&lt;project ID&gt;'</screen>
    </listitem>

   <para>
    Delete the desired data.

     <para>
      When a project is no longer relevant or a specific tenant is no longer
      used, delete all series for the project as follows:
     </para>
<screen>DROP SERIES WHERE _tenant_id = '&lt;project ID&gt;'</screen>
     <para>
      Example:
     </para>
<screen>DROP SERIES WHERE _tenant_id = '27620d7ee6e948e29172f1d0950bd6f4'</screen>

     <para>
      When a metrics is no longer relevant for a project, delete all series for
      the specific project and metrics as follows:
     </para>
<screen>DROP SERIES FROM "&lt;metrics&gt;" WHERE _tenant_id = '&lt;project ID&gt;'</screen>
     <para>
      Example:
