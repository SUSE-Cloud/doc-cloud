<para>HPE customers who have purchased both &kw-hos; and SLES
                            subscriptions with support from HPE will have one number to call for
                            troubleshooting, fault isolation and support from HPE technical support
                            specialists in &kw-hos; and SUSE technologies. If the
                            problem is isolated to SLES software itself the issue will be replicated
                            on a SUSE certified platform and escalated to SUSE for resolution.

<para>HPE will troubleshoot and fault isolate an issue at the Helion software

                            continued support. </para>
