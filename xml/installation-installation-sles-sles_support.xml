  &sls; (&slsa;) Host OS KVM and/or supported &slsa; guests
  have been tested and qualified by &vendor; to run on &kw-hos;. Refer to the
  published compatibility matrix for your version of &kw-hos; at the following
  URL <link xlink:href="http://docs.hpcloud.com/#home.html"/>. &vendor; is one of
  largest &suse; OEMs with follow the sun global support coverage.
  <!-- FIXME: The SUSE version of this is now saying that SUSE is a large OEM
  of SUSE. Similar nonsense below... - sknorr, 2018-02-05 -->

    &vendor; customers who have purchased both &kw-hos; and &slsa; subscriptions with
    support from &vendor; will have one number to call for troubleshooting, fault
    isolation and support from &vendor; technical support specialists in &kw-hos;
    and &suse; technologies. If the problem is isolated to &slsa; software itself
    the issue will be replicated on a &suse; certified platform and escalated to
    &suse; for resolution.

    the vendor from whom they purchased &slsa; for continued support.
