    &kw-hos-version-301;: Checking for Percona Cluster Partitioning</title>
<sidebar><para>A new check has been added to the Percona play to check whether your Percona cluster has
        become partitioned. If it has, you could have mutliple versions of your dtabase with
        incorrect/out of sync data which need to be re-aligned. This would typically cause
        unexplained behaviour or service errors because the MySQL databases which underpin services
        may not be in the same state on all nodes of your HLM cluster.</para>
<para>Partitioning could happen because of an issue present in an earlier version or by running
        bootstrap on one host of a cluster which has Percona up and running.</para>
<para>You can run this check to troubleshoot and correct the partitioned cluster.</para>
<para>This check is from the percona-status play and logs the following in the event of a
        cluster</para>

<para>Generally, in MySQL  all queries are directed to
            the first node of your cluster through haproxy, so the first node of the cluster or
            controller 1 is likely to be in the up-to-date cluster. Examine some of the service
