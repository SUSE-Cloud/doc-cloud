     When a user is disabled in the identity provider, the issued federated
     token from the service provider still remains valid until the token is
     expired based on the Keystone expiration setting.

    <para>
     An already issued federated token will retain its scope until its
     expiration. Any changes in the mapping on the service provider will not
     impact the scope of an already issued federated token. For example, if an
     already issued federated token was mapped to group1 that has scope on
     project1, and mapping is changed to group2 that has scope on project2, the
     prevously issued federated token still has scope on project1.

     Keystone-to-Keystone federation and WebSSO cannot be configured by putting

   Keystone relies on two cron jobs to periodically clean up expired tokens and

   system:

   By default, the two cron jobs are enabled on controller node 1 only, not on
   the other two nodes. When controller node 1 is down or has failed for any
   reason, these two cron jobs must be manually set up on one of the other two
   nodes.
