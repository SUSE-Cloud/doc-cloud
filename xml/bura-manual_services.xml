 <title>Manual Backup Overview</title>
 <para>
  This section covers manual backup and restore processes. To back up somewhere
  outside the cluster, please refer to <xref linkend="topic_jsc_qps_qt"/>. The
  following backups are covered:

    <title>&mariadb; database that is part of the Control Plane</title>
    <para>
     The &mariadb; database contains most of the data needed to restore
     services. While the &mariadb; database only allows for an incomplete
     recovery of ESX data, for other services it supports full recovery.
     Logging data in &elasticsearch; is not backed up. &swift; objects are
     not backed up because of the redundant nature of &swift;.

    <title>&swift; Rings used in the &swift; storage deployment </title>
    <para>
     &swift; rings are backed up so that you can recover more quickly even
     though &swift; can rebuild the rings without this data. Automatically
     rebuilding the rings is slower than restoring via a backup.

     Audit Logs are backed up to provide after-the-fact information and
     statistical data for performance and security purposes.

  The following services will be backed up; the
  data needed to restore the services is backed up. This includes databases and
  configuration-related files.
