 <title>Manual Backup Overview</title>
 <para>
  This section covers manual backup and some restore processes. Full
  documentation for restore operations is in <xref
  linkend="unplanned-maintenance"/>.To back up outside the cluster,
  refer to <xref linkend="topic-jsc-qps-qt"/>. Backups of the following types
  of resources are covered:

    <title>&mariadb; database that is part of the Control Plane</title>
    <para>
     The &mariadb; database contains most of the data needed to restore
     services. &mariadb; supports full back up and recovery for all services.
     Logging data in &elasticsearch; is not backed up. &swift; objects are
     not backed up because of the redundant nature of &swift;.

    <title>&swift; Rings used in the &swift; storage deployment </title>
    <para>
     &swift; rings are backed up so that you can recover more quickly than
     rebuilding with &swift;. &swift; can rebuild the rings without this backup
     data, but automatically rebuilding the rings is slower than restoring
     from a backup.

  The following services will be backed up. Specifically, the data needed to
  restore the services is backed up. This includes databases and
  configuration-related files.
