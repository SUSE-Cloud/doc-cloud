    <title>Usage</title>
    <procedure>
      <step>
        <para>Source the necessary project credentials. The administrative project
                        can delete resources for all other projects. A regular project can
                        delete its own network resources and those belonging to other projects
                        for which it has sufficient access.</para>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>Delete the network resources for a particular project.</para>
        <screen language="console">$ neutron purge PROJECT_ID</screen>
        <para>Replace <literal>PROJECT_ID</literal> with the project ID.</para>
      </step>
    </procedure>
    <para>The command provides output that includes a completion percentage and
                the quantity of successful or unsuccessful network resource deletions.
                An unsuccessful deletion usually indicates sharing of a resource with
                one or more additional projects.</para>
    <screen language="console">Purging resources: 100% complete.
Deleted 1 security_group, 2 ports, 1 router, 1 floatingip, 2 networks.
