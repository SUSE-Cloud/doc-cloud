                &kw-hos-version; supports the Hammer version of Ceph cluster. Ceph
                cluster is a distributed object storage solution that can scale horizontally up to
                multiple petabytes and is based on the Reliable Autonomic Distributed Object Store
                (RADOS) object-based storage system. Ceph cluster stores all data as objects. It
                also provides components that support other storage protocols. For example: RBD (
                RADOS Block Devices) supports block storage protocol, RADOS Gateway support S3/Swift
                API protocol for object storage access and so on. For example, RBD (RADOS Block
                Devices) supports the block storage protocol, RADOS Gateway supports the S3/Swift
                API protocol for object storage access, and so on. The following are Ceph’s key
                features :</para>

        <para>Ceph deployment is flexible. Although it supports a variety of storage protocols based on
            deployed components, you can add extra components (except mandatory ones) <emphasis>only</emphasis> if
            you need to support specific storage protocols. For example, if you are not going to
            support the S3/Swift protocol, then you might choose not to deploy the RADOS Gateway.
            For easy readability, the various aspects of cluster deployment, such as hardware
            configuration, service configuration parameters, and deployment architecture, are
            categorized into separate sections. Each major section is further categorized into
            following segments:</para>

</listitem>
            </itemizedlist>

        <para>Each sub-section provides recommendations vs. supported configurations. We recommend the
            production configuration, although all supported configurations are tested and

<para>Ceph clients transmits traffic
                directly to OSD daemons for storage operations instead of the client routing
                requests to a specific gateways. OSD daemons perform data replication and
                participate in recovery activities. In general, a storage pool is configured with a
                replica count of 3, causing daemons to transact three sets of client data over the
                cluster network. As a result, 4 MB of write traffic results in a total of 12 MB of
                data movement in the Ceph clusters (4 MB * 3 replicas = 12MB). Also, Ceph clusters
                routinely share data among themselves. It is important to segregate Ceph data
                traffic into three segments, as follows:</para>
<itemizedlist xml:id="ul_iqq_shn_fw">
                    <listitem><para>Management traffic, which includes monitoring and logging. </para>
</listitem>
                    <listitem><para>Client traffic (often termed as data traffic) includes client requests sent
                        to OSD daemons. </para>
</listitem>
                    <listitem><para>Cluster traffic (often termed as replication traffic), which includes
                        replication and recovery data traffic among OSD daemons.</para>
</listitem>
                </itemizedlist>
<para>For a high-performance clusters, a proper network configuration is very
                important. Use multiple networks for different data traffics. For a cluster of a
                reasonable size (a few terabytes), we recommend having a cluster with at least two
                networks, such as a single network for management and client data traffic
                (front-side) and a cluster (back-side) network. For large Ceph clusters, we
                recommend segregating all three traffic configurations. Segregation enables helps
                make for a secure connection because a cluster network is not required to be
                connected to the Internet directly. It allows OSD daemons to keep communicating
                without intervention so that placement groups can be brought to active and clean
                states relatively easily, whenever required. Apart from network sepration(using
                VLANs), be sure to consider NICs used for Ceph servers too. We strongly recommend
                using bonded NICs to prevent single points of failure. Note that the network (and
                hence VLAN) separation is different from NIC separation even though they are linked
                to each other. In a multi-network model, emphasize VLAN separation, which ideally
                should be complemented by NIC separation, using the following priority
                    order:</para>

                            interface which in turn necessiates having at least six NICs for OSD
