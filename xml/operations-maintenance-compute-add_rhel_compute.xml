 <title>Adding a &rhla; Compute Node</title>
 <para>
  Adding a &rhla; compute node allows you to add additional capacity for more
  virtual machines.
 </para>
 <para>
  You may have a need to add additional &rhla; compute hosts for more virtual
  machine capacity or another purpose and these steps will help you achieve
  this.
 </para>
 <para>
  There are two methods you can use to add &rhla; compute hosts to your
  environment:
 </para>
 <procedure>
  <step>
   <para>
    Adding &rhla; pre-installed compute hosts. This method does not require the
    &rhla; iso be on the &lcm; to complete.
   </para>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>
    Using the provided Ansible playbooks and Cobbler, &rhla; will be installed
    on your new compute hosts. This method requires that you provided a &rhla;
    7.3 ISO during the initial installation of your cloud, following the
    instructions at <xref linkend="rhel_overview"/>.
   </para>
   <para>
    If you want to use the provided Ansible playbooks and Cobbler to setup and
    configure your &rhla; hosts and you did not have the &rhla; 7.3 ISO on your
    &lcm; during your initial installation then ensure you look at
    the note at the top of that section before proceeding.
   </para>
  </step>
 </procedure>
 <section xml:id="idg-all-operations-maintenance-compute-add_rhel_compute-xml-5">
  <title>Prerequisites</title>
  <para>
   You need to ensure your input model files are properly setup for &rhla;
   compute host clusters. This must be done during the installation process of
   your cloud and is discussed further at <xref linkend="install_rhel"/> and
   <xref linkend="rhel_compute_model"/>.

     For example, if you already had a cluster of three &rhla; compute hosts
     using the <literal>RHEL-COMPUTE-ROLE</literal> role and needed to add a
     fourth one you would add your details to the bottom of the file in the
     format. Note that we left out the IPMI details because they will not be needed
     since you pre-installed the &rhla; OS on your host(s).

     assignment of the node you have added is what you expect. It may not be,
     as nodes will not be numbered consecutively if any have previously been
     removed. This is to prevent loss of data; the config processor retains
     data about removed nodes and keeps their ID numbers from being
