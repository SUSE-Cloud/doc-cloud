    <para>In addition to producing all of the data needed to deploy and configure the cloud, the
        configuration processor also creates a number of information files that provide details of
        the resulting configuration.</para>

    <para>These files can be found in <literal>~/helion/my_cloud/info</literal> after the first
        configuration processor run. This directory is also rebuilt each time the Configuration
        Processor is run.</para>

    <para>Most of the files are in YAML format, allowing them to be used in further automation tasks
        if required.</para>
