    <para>Network tags are defined by some [[[kw-hos]]]
        <guilabel>service-components</guilabel> and are used to convey information between the
        network model and the service, allowing the dependent aspects of the service to be
        automatically configured. <!----></para>

    <para>Network tags also convey requirements a service may have for aspects of the server network
        configuration, for example, that a bridge is required on the corresponding network device on
        a server where that service-component is installed.</para>

    <para>See  for more information on
        specific tags and their usage.</para>
