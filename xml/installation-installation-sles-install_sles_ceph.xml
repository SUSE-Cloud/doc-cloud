 <title>Using SLES as a Ceph Client</title>
 <warning>
  <para>
   <!-- FIXME: Old SLES version referenced. Also, should this mention SES
   instead of SLES? -->
   SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP2 comes with Ceph packages from the Ceph
   Jewel release. &kw-hos-phrase; Ceph server is based on the Ceph Hammer
   release, therefore it is not advised that client related Ceph management
   commands from a SLES compute node be performed. Doing so could trigger an
   update of the Ceph config which would not be compatible with other non-SLES
   Ceph clients in the same &kw-hos-phrase; system.
