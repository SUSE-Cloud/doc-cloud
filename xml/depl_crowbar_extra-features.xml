  <title>Skip Unready Nodes</title>
  <para>
   In large deployments with many nodes, there are always some nodes that are
   in a fail or unknown state. New &barcl;s cannot be applied to them and
   values cannot be updated in some &barcl;s that are already deployed. This
   happens because &crow; will refuse to apply a &barcl; to a list of nodes if
   they are not all in <literal>ready</literal> state.
  </para>
  <para>
   To avoid having to manually take out nodes that are not
   <literal>ready</literal>, there is a feature called <literal>skip unready
   nodes</literal>. Instead of refusing to apply the &barcl;, it will skip the
   nodes that it finds in any other state than <literal>ready</literal>.

  </para>
  <para>
   All &Barcl; roles are affected. The default config file includes all the
   roles that have been tested and found to be working. Adding roles to the
   default list is not supported for the <literal>skip_unready_nodes</literal>
   feature. Removing default roles is supported.

   <emphasis role="bold">Determining Which Nodes Were Skipped</emphasis>
  </para>
  <para>
   Skipped nodes are logged to the &crow; log
   (<filename>/var/log/crowbar/production.log</filename>) where you can search
   for the text <literal>skipped until next chef run</literal>. This will print
   the log lines where nodes were skipped, the name of the node, and the
   &barcl; which was being applied.
  </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;grep "skipped until next chef run" /var/log/crowbar/production.log</screen>
  <important>
   <para>
    After enabling/disabling the <literal>skip_unready_nodes</literal> feature
    or adding/removing roles, the &crow; framework service must be restarted
    (<command>systemctl restart crowbar</command>) in order to use the updated
    settings.
   </para>
  </important>

 <section>
  <title>Skip Unchanged Nodes</title>
  <para>
   When a &barcl; is applied, all nodes will run <literal>chef-client</literal>. Sometimes it is
   not necessary to run chef for each node as attributes or roles may have not
   changed for some of the nodes.
  </para>
  <para>
   The <literal>skip unchanged nodes</literal> feature allows nodes to be
   skipped if their attributes or roles have not changed. This can help speed
   up applying a barclamp, especially in large deployments and with roles that
   are usually applied to a lot of nodes, such as &o_comp;.
