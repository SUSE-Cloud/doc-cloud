  <title>&secret_store; Service Overview</title>
  <para>
   &secret_store; is an &ostack; key management service offering secure storage,
   provisioning, and management of key data. The &secret_store; service provides
   management of secrets, keys and certificates via multiple storage back-ends.
   The support for various back ends is provided via a plug-in mechanism, a Key
   Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) plug-in for a KMIP-compliant HSM
   Hardware Secure Module (HSM) device. &secret_store; supports symmetric and
   asymmetric key generation using various algorithms. Cinder, neutron-lbaas v2
   and Nova will integrate with &secret_store; for their encryption key
   generation and storage.
  </para>
  <para>
   &secret_store; has two types of core feature sets:

   The major features of the &secret_store; key management service are:

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The ability to encrypt volumes/disks. In an &ostack; context, this
     means support for encrypting Cinder volumes (volume encryption). Cinder
     has its own key manager interface (KeyMgr) and can use BarbicanClient as
     one of its implementations. By default in &kw-hos-phrase;, Cinder uses
     &secret_store; as its key manager when &secret_store; is enabled. KeyMgr
     encrypts data
     in the virtualization host before writing data to the remote disk. There
     are three options available in &kw-hos;:

   &secret_store; currently supports databases and KMIP as its secret store

  <note>
   <para>
    For a &secret_store; deployment with a database back-end, the master key

    Once the master key is set, it must not be modified.

  </note>
  <note>
   <para>
    Changing the master key can result in read errors for existing secrets as
    those secrets are stored in the database and are encrypted using the
    previous master key. Once a new master key is used, &secret_store; will not
    be able to read those secrets. Also it will not be able to create new
    secrets within that project as the project key is encrypted using previous
    master key.

  <bridgehead renderas="sect4">KMIP Plug-in Support</bridgehead>
  <para>
   &secret_store; has a KMIP plug-in to store encryption keys (called secrets in
   &secret_store; service terminology) in an HSM device using the KMIP protocol.
   This plug-in has been tested against &mf; ESKM with KMIP server. To
   enable support for it, &secret_store; needs to be configured with the
   corresponding plug-in
   connection details, and client certificate information needs to be defined
   in its configuration. The ESKM KMIP server uses a client certificate to
   validate a KMIP client connection established by the &secret_store; server.
   As part of that KMIP configuration, playbooks provide a mechanism to upload
   your client certs to nodes hosting the &secret_store; API server.

  <title>Auditing &secret_store; Events</title>
  <para>
   The &secret_store; service supports auditing and uses
   <xref linkend="idg-all-security-middleware-auditing-xml-1"/> to generate
   auditing data in Cloud Auditing Data Federation (CADF) format. The &kw-hos;
   input model has a mechanism to enable and disable auditing on a per-service
   basis. When &secret_store; auditing is enabled, it writes audit messages to
   an audit log file that is separate from the &secret_store; internal logging.
   The base location of audit log file is driven by common auditing
   configuration.
  </para>
  <bridgehead renderas="sect4">Enabling and Disabling Auditing</bridgehead>
  <para>
   The auditing of &secret_store; events can be enabled and disabled through the
   &secret_store; reconfigure playbook. As part of the configuration of
   &secret_store;, its audit messages can be directed to a log or to a
   messaging queue. By default, messages are written to the &secret_store; log
   file. Once an architecture-level decision is made with regards to the
   default consumer of audit events (either logging or messaging), the
   &secret_store; service can be configured to use
   it as the default option when auditing is enabled.
  </para>
  <para>
   Auditing can be disabled or enabled by following these steps on the &clm;
   node.
  </para>
  <procedure>
   <title>Enabling or Disabling Auditing</title>
   <step>
    <para>
     Edit the file

   <step>
    <para>
     Any service (including &secret_store;) that is listed under
     enabled-services or disabled-services will override the default setting.
     To enable auditing, make sure that the &secret_store; service name is in
     the enabled-services list
     of the <literal>audit-settings</literal> section or is not present in
     disabled-services list when default: is set to enabled.

     The <literal>default: enabled</literal> setting applies to all services.
     If you want to disable (or enable) a few, whichever is the opposite of the
     default global setting you used, you can do so in a disabled-services (or
     enabled-services) section below it. Here the enabled-services entry is
