   2017-05-31 - shermann:  @taroth: Since there is no need for
   installation/configuration issues as described in the original cmm sources,
   the appendices describing the standard and additional metrics have also been
   removed. Nevertheless, we think that it is necessary for an OpenStack
   operator to have basic info on the metrics he/she can use for monitoring the
   OS environment. Will you include the info in the Deployment Guide? Or at
   least a link to the Monasca Agent doc where the plugins are described?

  SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring is automatically installed and configured if
  you deploy the Monasca barclamp. For details, see the SUSE OpenStack Cloud
  <citetitle>Deployment Guide</citetitle>, chapter <citetitle>Deploying the
  OpenStack Services</citetitle>, section <citetitle>Deploying Monasca</citetitle>.
