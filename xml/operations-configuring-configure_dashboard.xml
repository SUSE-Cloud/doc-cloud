 <title>Configuring the Dashboard Service</title>
 <para>
  Horizon is the OpenStack service that serves as the basis for the &productname;
  dashboards.

  including Compute, Volume Operations, Networking, and Identity.
 </para>
 <para>
  Along the left side of the dashboard are sections that provide access to
  Project and Identity sections. If your login credentials have been assigned
  the 'admin' role you will also see a separate Admin section that provides
  additional system-wide setting options.
 </para>

  Across the top are menus to switch between projects and menus where you can
  access user settings.

  <title>Dashboard Service and TLS in &productname;</title>
  <para>
   By default, the Dashboard service is configured with TLS in the input model
   (ardana-input-model). You should not disable TLS in the input model for the
   Dashboard service. The normal use case for users is to have all services
   behind TLS, but users are given the freedom in the input model to take a
   service off TLS for troubleshooting or debugging. TLS should always be
   enabled for production environments.

   <literal>horizon_private_protocol</literal> are both be set to use https.
