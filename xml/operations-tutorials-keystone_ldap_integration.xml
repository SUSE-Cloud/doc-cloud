 <title>Integrating &kw-hos; with an LDAP System</title>
 <para>
  You can configure your &kw-hos; cloud to work with an outside user
  authentication source such as Active Directory or OpenLDAP. Keystone, the
  &productname; identity service, functions as the first stop for any user
  authorization/authentication requests. Keystone can also function as a proxy
  for user account authentication, passing along authentication and
  authorization requests to any LDAP-enabled system that has been configured as
  an outside source. This type of integration lets you use an existing
  user-management system such as Active Directory and its powerful group-based
  organization features as a source for permissions in &kw-hos;.
 </para>
 <para>
  Upon successful completion of this tutorial, your cloud will refer user
  authentication requests to an outside LDAP-enabled directory system, such as
  Microsoft Active Directory or OpenLDAP.

  <title>Configure your LDAP source</title>
  <para>
   To configure your &kw-hos; cloud to use an outside user-management source,
   perform the following steps:
  </para>
  <procedure>
   <step>
    <para>
     Make sure that the LDAP-enabled system you plan to integrate with is up
     and running and accessible over the necessary ports from your cloud
     management network.

     Edit the

     Create a YAML file in the
     <filename>/var/lib/ardana/openstack/my_cloud/config/keystone/</filename>
     directory that defines your LDAP connection. You can make a copy of the
     sample Keystone-LDAP configuration file, and then edit that file with the
     details of your LDAP connection.

      # Please note:
      #  1. LDAP configuration is read-only. Configuration which performs write operations (i.e. creates users, groups, etc)
      #     is not supported at the moment.
      #  2. LDAP is only supported for identity operations (reading users and groups from LDAP). Assignment
      #     operations with LDAP (i.e. managing roles, projects) are not supported.
      #  3. LDAP is configured as non-default domain. Configuring LDAP as a default domain is not supported.
