 <title>&kw-hos-tm; 5.0: Delta Upgrades</title>
 <para>
  It is now possible to apply minor, patch and hot-fix updates using
  <literal>delta</literal> kits. These <literal>delta</literal> kits contain
  only the set of changes directly related to the update, so they are smaller
  in size, and more importantly, they reduce the impact of the update on a
  running cloud, by only modifying the services that have changed in that
  release.
 </para>
 <para>
  A full &kw-hos; kit contains the following elements:
 </para>
 <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    A set of packages: &hlinux; debs and RHEL rpms.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    A set of python virtual environments (one per service/distro combination).
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    A set of Ansible playbooks for both &clm; setup and carrying
    out lifecycle operations for an OpenStack cloud (deploy, upgrade, etc.)
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    A set of input model yaml files, which contains both &kw-hos; service
    definitions and example sets of cloud model files.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    A set of config file symlinks, which determines the configuration files
    that are exposed for customer modification in the
    <literal>my_cloud</literal> area on the &clm;.
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </itemizedlist>
 <para>
  A patch kit will contain only the venvs that have changed (relative to the
  prior release). So in comparison to the full kit, a patch kit will have:
 </para>
 <orderedlist>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    The set of new or modified venvs relative to the previous release.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    A complete set of Ansible playbooks, input model yml file and config file
    symlinks. Regardless of the changes being supplied in a minor/patch update
    kit, these will always be supplied in full. This size of these artefacts is
    insignificant in comparison with hlinux/RHEL packages and service venvs.
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </orderedlist>
 <para>
  There are a number of considerations to take into account when using delta
  upgrades:
 </para>
 <orderedlist>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    The use of a patch kit does not simplify the operations needed to upgrade
    your cloud - the same upgrade procedure will be followed whether using a
    patch kit or a full kit.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    A minor, patch or hotfix release can only be applied on top of a cloud
    running with the immediately preceding release, for example:
   </para>
   <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      2.1.5 delta update can be applied on top of a 2.1.4 cloud
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      2.1.5 delta update cannot be applied on top of a 2.1.3 cloud
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </orderedlist>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    The delta update process will not support major upgrades, e.g. 2.x to 3.0,
    or any upgrade involving a change in OpenStack release.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    The individual service venvs in a patch kit are complete venvs, not patches
    for the venvs.
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </orderedlist>
