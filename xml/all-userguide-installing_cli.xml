        <title>Installing the Command-Line Clients</title>

        <para>During the installation, by default, the suite of OpenStack command-line tools are
                installed on the lifecycle manager and the control plane in your environment. This
                includes the OpenStack Command-Line Interface as well as the clients for the
                individual services such as the NovaClient, CinderClient, and SwiftClient. You can
                learn more about these in the OpenStack documentation here: <link
                        xlink:href="http://docs.openstack.org/cli-reference/">OpenStack Command-Line
                        Interface Reference</link>.</para>
        <para>If you wish to install the command-line interfaces on other nodes in your environment,
                there are two methods you can use to do so that we describe below.</para>

                <title>Installing the CLI tools using the input model</title>
                <para>During the initial install phase of your cloud you can edit your input model
                        to request that the command-line clients be installed on any of the node
                        clusters in your environment. To do so, follow these steps:</para>

                                <para>In this file you will see a list of
                                                <literal>service-components</literal> to be
                                        installed on each of your clusters. These clusters will be
                                        divided per role, with your controller node cluster likely
                                        coming at the beginning. Here you will see a list of each of
                                        the clients that can be installed. These include: </para>

                <para>At any point after your initial installation you can install the command-line
                        clients on any of the nodes in your environment. To do so, follow these
