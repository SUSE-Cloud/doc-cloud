    <bridgehead  renderas="sect4">Determining Your User Credentials</bridgehead><para>On your lifecycle manager, in the
          <literal>~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible/group_vars/</literal> directory you will find
        several files. In the one labeled as first control plane node you can locate the user
        credentials for both the Administrator user (<literal>admin</literal>) and your Demo user
          (<literal>demo</literal>) which you will use to perform many other actions on your
        cloud.</para>
<para>For example, if you are using the Entry-scale KVM with VSA model and used the default
        naming scheme given in the example configuration files, you can use these commands on your
        lifecycle manager to GREP for your user credentials:</para>
<para><emphasis role="bold">Administrator</emphasis></para>
<screen >grep keystone_admin_pwd entry-scale-kvm-vsa-control-plane-1</screen><para><emphasis role="bold">Demo</emphasis></para>
<screen >grep keystone_demo_pwd entry-scale-kvm-vsa-control-plane-1</screen>


    <bridgehead  renderas="sect4">Configure your lifecycle manager to use the command-line
        tools</bridgehead><para>This playbook will do a series of steps to update your environment variables for your cloud
        so you can use command-line clients.</para>
<para>Run the following command, which will replace <literal>/etc/hosts</literal> on the lifecycle
        manager:</para>
<screen >cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts cloud-client-setup.yml</screen><para>As the /etc/hosts file no longer has entries for Helion lifecycle management, sudo commands
        may become a bit slower. To fix this issue, once this step is complete, add "hlm" after
        "127.0.0.1 localhost". The result will look like this:</para>
<screen >...
# Localhost Information
127.0.0.1 localhost hlm</screen>

    <bridgehead  renderas="sect4">Protect home directory</bridgehead><para>The home directory of the user that owns the &kw-hos-phrase; scripts 
        should not be world readable.  Change the permissions so that they are only readable 
        by the owner:
        </para>
<screen >chmod 0700 ~</screen>


    <bridgehead  renderas="sect4">Back up Your SSH Keys</bridgehead><para>As part of the cloud deployment setup process, SSH keys to access the systems are generated
        and stored in <literal>~/.ssh</literal> on your lifecycle manager.</para>
<para>These SSH keys allow access to the subsequently deployed systems and should be included in
        the list of content to be archived in any backup strategy.</para>

        <listitem><para>Log in to your lifecycle manager.</para>

<screen>openstack endpoint list</screen>
<tip><para>You can use <literal>openstack -h</literal> to access the client help
            file and a full list of commands.</para>
