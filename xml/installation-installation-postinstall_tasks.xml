 <section>
  <title>Determining Your User Credentials</title>
  <para>
   On your &lcm;, in the
   <literal>~/scratch/ansible/next/ardana/ansible/group_vars/</literal> directory
   you will find several files. In the one labeled as first control plane node
   you can locate the user credentials for both the Administrator user
   (<literal>admin</literal>) and your Demo user (<literal>demo</literal>)
   which you will use to perform many other actions on your cloud.
  </para>
  <para>
   For example, if you are using the Entry-scale KVM model and used
   the default naming scheme given in the example configuration files, you can
   use these commands on your &lcm; to <command>grep</command> for your user
   credentials:
  </para>
  <para>
   <emphasis role="bold">Administrator</emphasis>
  </para>
<screen>grep keystone_admin_pwd entry-scale-kvm-control-plane-1</screen>
  <para>
   <emphasis role="bold">Demo</emphasis>
  </para>
<screen>grep keystone_demo_pwd entry-scale-kvm-control-plane-1</screen>
 </section>
 <section>
  <title>Configure your &lcm; to use the command-line tools</title>
  <para>
   This playbook will do a series of steps to update your environment variables
   for your cloud so you can use command-line clients.
  </para>
  <para>
   Run the following command, which will replace <literal>/etc/hosts</literal>
   on the &lcm;:
  </para>
<screen>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/ardana/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts cloud-client-setup.yml</screen>
  <para>
   As the <filename>/etc/hosts</filename> file no longer has entries for &lcm;,
   sudo commands may become a bit slower. To fix this issue, once
   this step is complete, add "ardana" after "127.0.0.1 localhost". The result
   will look like this:
  </para>
<screen>...
# Localhost Information
127.0.0.1 localhost ardana</screen>
 </section>
 <section>
  <title>Protect home directory</title>
  <para>
   The home directory of the user that owns the &kw-hos-phrase; scripts should
   not be world readable. Change the permissions so that they are only readable
   by the owner:
  </para>
<screen>chmod 0700 ~</screen>
 </section>
 <section>
  <title>Back up Your SSH Keys</title>
  <para>
   As part of the cloud deployment setup process, SSH keys to access the
   systems are generated and stored in <literal>~/.ssh</literal> on your
   &lcm;.
  </para>
  <para>
   These SSH keys allow access to the subsequently deployed systems and should
   be included in the list of content to be archived in any backup strategy.
  </para>
 </section>
 <section>
  <title>Retrieving Service Endpoints</title>
  <procedure>
   <step>
    <para>
     Log in to your &lcm;.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Source the keystone admin credentials:
    </para>
<screen>unset OS_TENANT_NAME
source ~/keystone.osrc</screen>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Using the OpenStack command-line tool you can then query the Keystone
     service for your endpoints:
    </para>
<screen>openstack endpoint list</screen>
    <tip>
     <para>
      You can use <literal>openstack -h</literal> to access the client help
      file and a full list of commands.
     </para>
    </tip>
   </step>
  </procedure>
  <para>
