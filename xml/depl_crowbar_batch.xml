  <title>Description</title>

  <para>
   <command>crowbar batch</command> provides a quick way of creating,
   updating, and applying &crow; proposals. It can be used to:

  <para>
   As the name suggests, <command>crowbar batch</command> is intended to be
   run in <quote>batch mode</quote>, that is mostly unattended. It has two
   modes of operation:
  </para>

  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>crowbar batch export
    </term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Exports a YAML file which describes existing proposals and how their
      parameters deviate from the default proposal values for that
      &barcl;.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>crowbar batch build
    </term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Imports a YAML file in the same format as above, and uses it to build
      new proposals if they don't yet exist, and then update the existing
      proposals so that their parameters match those given in the YAML file.

 <sect1 xml:id="sec.deploy.crowbatch.yaml">
  <title>YAML file format</title>

  <para>
   Here is an example YAML file. At the top-level, there is a proposals
   array, each entry of which is a hash representing a proposal:
  </para>

<screen>proposals:
- barclamp: provisioner
  # Proposal name defaults to 'default'.
  attributes:
    shell_prompt: USER@ALIAS:CWD SUFFIX
- barclamp: database
  # Default attributes are good enough, so we just need to assign
  # nodes to roles:
  deployment:
    elements:
      database-server:
        - @@controller1@@
- barclamp: rabbitmq
  deployment:
    elements:
      rabbitmq-server:
        - @@controller1@@</screen>

   <title>Top-level proposal attributes</title>
   <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
     <term>barclamp
     </term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Name of the &barcl; for this proposal (required).
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
     <term>name
     </term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Name of this proposal (optional; defaults to
       <literal>default</literal>). In <command>build</command> mode, if the
       proposal does not already exist, it will be created.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
     <term>attributes
     </term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       An optional nested hash containing any attributes for this proposal
       which deviate from the defaults for the &barcl;.
      </para>
      <para>
       In <command>export</command> mode, any attributes set to the default
       values are excluded to keep the YAML as short and readable as
       possible.
      </para>
      <para>
       In <command>build</command> mode, these attributes are deep-merged
       with the current values for the proposal. If the proposal didn't
       already exist, batch build will create it first, so the attributes
       are effectively merged with the default values for the &barcl;'s
       proposal.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
     <term>wipe_attributes
     </term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       An optional array of paths to nested attributes which should be
       removed from the proposal.
      </para>
      <para>
       Each path is a period-delimited sequence of attributes; for example
       <literal>pacemaker.stonith.sbd.nodes</literal> would remove all SBD
       nodes from the proposal if it already exists. If a path segment
       contains a period, it should be escaped with a backslash, for example
       <literal>segment-one.segment\.two.segment_three</literal>.
      </para>
      <para>
       This removal occurs before the deep merge described above, so for
       example a batch build with a YAML file which included
       <literal>pacemaker.stonith.sbd.nodes</literal> in
       <literal>wipe_attributes</literal> of a pacemaker &barcl; proposal
       would ensure that at the end of the run, only SBD nodes listed in the
       attributes sibling hash would be used. In contrast, without the
       <literal>wipe_attributes</literal> entry, the SBD nodes given would
       be appended to any SBD nodes already defined in the proposal.

    <varlistentry>
     <term>deployment
     </term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       A nested hash defining how and where this proposal should be
       deployed.
      </para>
      <para>
       In <command>build</command> mode, this hash is deep-merged in the
       same way as the attributes hash, except that the array of elements
       for each &chef; role is reset to the empty list before the deep
       merge. This special exception may change in the future.

  <sect2 xml:id="sec.deploy.crowbatch.yaml.subst">
   <title>Node alias substitutions</title>
   <para>
    Any string anywhere in the YAML which is of the form
    <literal>@@<replaceable>node</replaceable>@@</literal> and where
    <replaceable>node</replaceable> is a node alias will be substituted for
    the name of that node. For example if <literal>controller1</literal> is
    a &crow; alias for node
    <literal>d52-54-02-77-77-02.mycloud.com</literal>, then
    <literal>@@controller1@@</literal> will be substituted for that host
    name. This allows YAML files to be reused across environments.

  <title>Options</title>

  <para>
   In addition to the standard options available to every
   <command>crowbar</command> subcommand (run <command>crowbar batch
   --help</command> for a full list), there are some extra options
   specifically for <command>crowbar batch</command>:
  </para>

  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>--include &lt;barclamp[.proposal]&gt;
    </term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Only include the &barcl; / proposals given.
     </para>
     <para>
      This option can be repeated multiple times. The inclusion value can
      either be the name of a &barcl; (for example
      <literal>pacemaker</literal>) or a specifically named proposal within
      the &barcl; (for example
      <literal>pacemaker.network_cluster</literal>).
     </para>
     <para>
      If it is specified, then only the &barcl; / proposals specified are
      included in the build or export operation, and all others are ignored.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>--exclude &lt;barclamp[.proposal]&gt;
    </term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      This option can be repeated multiple times. The exclusion value is the
      same format as for <option>--include</option>. The &barcl;s /
      proposals specified are excluded from the build or export operation.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>--timeout &lt;seconds&gt;
    </term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Change the timeout for &crow; API calls.
     </para>
     <para>
      As &chef;'s run lists grow, some of the later &ostack;
      &barcl; proposals (for example &o_comp;, &o_dash;, or
      &o_orch; can take over 5 or even 10 minutes to apply), so you may
      need to increase this timeout to 900 seconds in some circumstances.
