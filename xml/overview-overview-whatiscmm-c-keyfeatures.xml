  services and servers are working appropriately.
 </para>
 <para>
  <phrase>SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</phrase> provides comprehensive and
  configurable metrics with reasonable defaults for monitoring the status,
  capacity, throughput, and latency of cloud systems. <phrase>SUSE OpenStack
  Cloud Monitoring</phrase> users can set their own warnings and critical
  thresholds and can combine multiple warnings and thresholds to support the
  processing of complex events. Combined with a notification system, these
  alerting features enable them to quickly analyze and resolve problems in the

 <bridgehead renderas="sect4">Log Management</bridgehead>
 <para>
  With the increasing complexity of cloud infrastructures, it is becoming more
  and more difficult and time-consuming for the system operator to gather,
  store, and query the large amounts of log data manually. To cope with these
  problems, <phrase>SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</phrase> provides
  centralized log management features.
 </para>
 <para>
  <phrase>SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</phrase> collects log data from all
  services and servers the cloud infrastructure is composed of. The log data
  from a large number of sources can be accessed from a single dashboard.
  Integrated search, filter, and graphics options enable system operators to
  isolate problems and narrow down potential root causes. <phrase>SUSE
  OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</phrase> thus provides valuable insights into the
  log data, even with large amounts of data resulting from highly complex
  environments.
 </para>
 <para>
  Based on <phrase>SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</phrase>'s alerting features
  and notification system, users can also configure warnings and critical
  thresholds for log data. If the number of critical log entries reaches a
  defined threshold, the users receive a warning and can instantly analyze
  their logs and start troubleshooting.
