  This topic describes how to check whether a file system in a partition has a
  label.
 </para>
 <para>
  To check whether a file system in a partition has a label, perform the
  following step:
 </para>
 <procedure>
  <step>
   <para>
    Log on to the server and execute the <literal>xfs_admin</literal> command
    (where <literal>/dev/sdc1</literal> is the partition where the file system
    is located):
   </para>
<screen>sudo xfs_admin -l /dev/sdc1</screen>
   <para>
    The output shows if a file system has a label. For example, this shows a
    label of <emphasis role="bold">c0a8f502h000</emphasis>:
   </para>
<screen>$ sudo xfs_admin -l /dev/sdc1
label = "<emphasis role="bold">c0a8f502h000</emphasis>"</screen>
   <para>
    If no file system exists, the result is as follows:
   </para>
<screen>$ sudo xfs_admin -l /dev/sde1
xfs_admin: /dev/sde is not a valid XFS file system (unexpected SB magic number 0x00000000)</screen>
   <para>
    If you are about to install and deploy the system, you must delete the
    label before starting the deployment. As part of the deployment process,
    the system will label the partition.
   </para>
  </step>
