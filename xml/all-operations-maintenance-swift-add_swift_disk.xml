      hosting Swift services.</para>You may have a need to add additional disks to a node for
    Swift usage and we can show you how. These steps work for adding additional disks to Swift
    object or proxy, account, container (PAC) nodes. It can also apply to adding additional disks to
    a controller node that is hosting the Swift service, like you would see if you are using one of
    the entry-scale example models.<para>Read through the notes below before beginning the
    process.</para></para>

        <listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">IMPORTANT!</emphasis> You must add the <emphasis role="bold">same</emphasis> number of disks to each server that the
          disk model applies to. So, for example, if you have a single cluster of three Swift
          servers and you want to increase capacity and decide to add two additional disks, you must
          add two to each of your three Swift servers.</para>
