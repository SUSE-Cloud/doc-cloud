 <title>SLES Compute Node Installation Overview</title>
 <para>
  &kw-hos-phrase; supports SLES compute nodes, specifically SLES 12 SP2. HPE
  does not ship a SLES ISO with &kw-hos; so you will need to download a copy of
  the SLES iso (SLE-12-SP2-Server-DVD-x86_64-GM-DVD1.iso) and the SLES SDK ISO
  (SLE-12-SP2-SDK-DVD-x86_64-GM-DVD1.iso) from SUSE. You can use the following
  link to download the ISO. To do so, you will need to sign in or create a SUSE
  customer service account before downloading:

  There are two approaches for deploying SLES compute nodes in &kw-hos;:
 </para>
 <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Using the lifecycle manager to automatically deploy SLES Compute nodes.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Provisioning SLES nodes yourself, either manually or using a 3rd party
    tool, and then provide the relevant information to the lifecycle manager.
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </itemizedlist>
 <para>
  These two approaches can be used whether you are installing a cloud for the
  first time or adding a compute node to an existing cloud. Regardless of your
  approach, you should be certain to register your SLES compute nodes in order
  to get product updates as they come available. For more information, see
