  <title>Upgrading from &kw-hos-phrase; 4.0.4</title>
  <warning>
   <para>
    If your system is currently on version &kw-hos-phrase; 4.0.4 the correct

  <title>OpenStack Security Advisory OSSA-2017-001</title>
  <para>
   The OpenStack Security Advisory OSSA-2017-001 which describes CVE-2017-2592
   was released on January 26, 2017. It discloses a security defect which
   causes Keystone tokens to be logged when a Neutron API call encounters
   unexpected error conditions. When this happens, the log entry that contains
   the token is propagated to the centralized logging facility. The result is
   that anyone with access to the centralized logging facility or the local log
   file containing the token could use the token to impersonate the owner of
   the token until the token expires. Tokens expire in 4 hours by default.
   Neutron is the only &kw-hos; service affected by this issue. The error
   conditions which cause this token to leak into the logs are not expected to
   happen frequently. However, customers should be aware of this risk.
   Customers may wish to further limit the access to the centralized logging
   facility and watch for suspicious activity that could indicate usage of a
   stolen Keystone token to impersonate another user. The Keystone token
   timeout value could also be changed but it is not recommended; testing would
   be required to ensure things still work in the customer environment if the
   token timeout value is reduced.

  <title>&kw-hos; Directory Umask</title>
  <para>
   &kw-hos; directory umask is 0022. Changing this value may cause unstable
   internal communication in the &kw-hos; product and will negatively affect
   upgrade.

  <title>Adding Top-Level Domains with Designate</title>
  <para>
   In &kw-hos-phrase; and earlier ( with designate V2.0.1 ) when using
   Designate to add Top-Level Domains (that controls who can create zones),
   there is a caching defect. When an entry is made to the tld list

  <title>Adding New Flavors After Upgrade</title>
  <para>
   After upgrading to &kw-hos-phrase; from &kw-hos-phrase; 4.0 you may
   experience an error when attempting to add new flavors.
  </para>
  <para>
   Example:
  </para>
<screen>$ openstack flavor create --ram 512 --vcpus 1 --disk 0 --ephemeral 0 --swap 0 --public m1.tinystu

Not all flavors have been migrated to the API database (HTTP 409) (Request-ID: req-bdae0a10-e6c3-42d4-9a58-b4438fcc4309)</screen>
  <para>
   This is caused by the time fields associated with the flavor not being
   updated correctly. You can view the time fields by selecting all from the
   instance_types table in the nova mysql database.
  </para>
<screen>$ sudo mysql
$ use nova
$ select * from instance_types;</screen>
  <para>
   The time fields <emphasis role="bold">created_at</emphasis>,
   <emphasis role="bold">updated_at</emphasis> or
   <emphasis role="bold">deleted_at</emphasis> may have invalid dates or not
   all of the fields are NULL.
  </para>
  <para>
   To resolve the new flavors issues the time fields must all be set to NULL.
  </para>
<screen>$ sudo mysql
$ use nova
$ update instance_types set created_at=NULL, updated_at=NULL, deleted_at=NULL;</screen>
  <para>
   Once the tables are updated, exit mysql and run the following command.
  </para>
<screen>$ sudo /opt/stack/service/nova-api/venv/bin/nova-manage --config-dir /opt/stack/service/nova-api/etc/nova db online_data_migrations</screen>
  <para>

  <title>Vertica Log Rotation</title>
  <para>
   Vertica database logs are not rotated automatically for non-primary cluster
   nodes. As a result, Vertica logs on those nodes may grow continuously,
   eventually filling the filesystem to its capacity. This issue can be patched
   by logging into each node with Vertica installed and run the following
   command.
  </para>
<screen>echo -e '#!/bin/sh
logrotate /opt/vertica/config/logrotate_base.conf' | sudo tee /etc/cron.daily/vertica-logrotate; sudo chmod 755 /etc/cron.daily/vertica-logrotate</screen>
  <para>
   While this step is not necessary on the Vertica cluster's primary node, it
   is also not harmful. This command is idempotent and future-proof with regard
   to upgrading to later &kw-hos; versions.

  <para>
   If you are experiencing intermittent or persistent failures during the early

   STP.

  <para>
   You can work around this issue by enabling rapid spanning tree protocol on
   the switch. If this is not an option due to conservative loop detection
   strategies, rebuild ipxe images with higher DHCP timeouts, or alternatively
   maintain link status to the server NICs during power cycles.
