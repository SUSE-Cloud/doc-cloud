 <para>
  &productname; provides a monitoring solution based on OpenStackâ€™s Monasca
  service. This service provides monitoring and metrics for all OpenStack
  components, as well as much of the underlying system. By default, &productname;
  comes with a set of alarms that provide coverage of the primary systems. In
  addition, you can define alarms based on threshold values for any metrics
  defined in the system. You can view alarm information in the Operations
  Console. You can also receive or deliver this information to others by
  configuring email or other mechanisms. Alarms provide information about
  whether a component failed and is affecting the system, and also what
  condition triggered the alarm.

  Here is a list of the included service-specific alarms and the recommended
  troubleshooting steps. We have organized these alarms by the section of the
  &productname; &opscon;, they are organized in as well as the
  <literal>service</literal> dimension defined.
