  Before contacting support to help you with a problem on &cloud;, we recommend
  gathering as much information as possible about your system and the
  problem. For this purpose, &productname; ships with a tool called
  <command>supportconfig</command>. It gathers system information such as the
  current kernel version being used, the hardware, RPM database, partitions,
  and other items. <command>supportconfig</command> also collects the most
  important log files. This information assists support staff to identify and
  solve your problem.

 <para>
  Always run <command>supportconfig</command> on the &clm; and on the
  &contrnode;(s). If a &compnode; or a &stornode; is part of the problem, run
  <command>supportconfig</command> on the affected node as well. For details on
  how to run <command>supportconfig</command>, see
