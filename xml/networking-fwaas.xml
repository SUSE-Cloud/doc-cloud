 <title>Using Firewall as a Service (FWaaS)</title>
 <para>
  The Firewall as a Service (FWaaS) provides the ability to assign
  network-level, port security for all traffic entering and existing a tenant
  network. More information on this service can be found via the public
  OpenStack documentation located at
  <link xlink:href="http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/neutron-specs/specs/api/firewall_as_a_service__fwaas_.html"/>.
  The following documentation provides command-line interface example
  instructions for configuring and testing a firewall. The Firewall as a
  Service can also be configured and managed by the Horizon web interface.
 </para>
 <para>
  FWaaS is implemented directly in the L3 agent
  (<emphasis>neutron-l3-agent</emphasis>), however if VPNaaS is enabled, FWaaS
  is implemented in the VPNaaS agent (<emphasis>neutron-vpn-agent</emphasis>).
  Because FWaaS does not use a separate agent process or start a specific
  service, there currently are no Monasca alarms for it.
 </para>
 <para>
  If DVR is enabled, the firewall service currently does not filter traffic
  between OpenStack private networks, also known as <emphasis>east-west
  traffic</emphasis> and will only filter traffic from external networks, also
  known as <emphasis>north-south traffic</emphasis>.

    <para>
     Create new firewall rules using <literal>firewall-rule-create</literal>
     command and providing the protocol, action (allow, deny, reject) and name
     for the new rule.
    </para>
    <para>
     Firewall actions provide rules in which data traffic can be handled. An
     <emphasis role="bold">allow</emphasis> rule will allow traffic to pass
     through the firewall,
     <emphasis role="bold">deny</emphasis>
     will stop and prevent data traffic from passing through the firewall and
     <emphasis role="bold">reject</emphasis>
     will reject the data traffic and return a
     <emphasis>destination-unreachable</emphasis> response. Using
     <emphasis role="bold">reject</emphasis> will speed up failure detection
     time dramatically for legitimate users, since they will not be required to
     wait for retransmission timeouts or submit retries. Some customers should
     stick with <emphasis role="bold">deny</emphasis> where prevention of port
     scanners and similar methods may be attempted by hostile attackers. Using
     <emphasis role="bold">deny</emphasis>
     will drop all of the packets, making it more difficult for malicious
     intent. The firewall action, <emphasis role="bold">deny</emphasis> is the
     default behavior.
    </para>

     The example below demonstrates how to allow icmp and ssh while denying
     access to http. See the <literal>neutron</literal> command-line reference

     <para>
      You can create a firewall rule with an identical name and each instance
      will have a unique id associated with the created rule, however for
      clarity purposes this is not recommended.

     You should expect to see curl fail over port 80 because of the deny-http

  <warning>
   <para>
    When using reference implementation, new networks, FIPs and routers created
    after the Firewall creation will not be automatically updated with firewall
    rules. Thus, execute the firewall-update command by passing the current and
    new router Ids such that the rules are reconfigured across all the routers
    (both current and new).

    For example if router-1 is created before and router-2 is created after the

   Firewalls are based in IPtable settings.

  <para>
   Each firewall that is created is known as an instance.
  </para>
  <para>
   A firewall instance can be deployed on selected project routers. If no
   specific project router is selected, a firewall instance is automatically
   applied to all project routers.
  </para>
  <para>
   Only 1 firewall instance can be applied to a project router.
  </para>
  <para>
   Only 1 firewall policy can be applied to a firewall instance.
  </para>
  <para>
   Multiple firewall rules can be added and applied to a firewall policy.
  </para>
  <para>
   Firewall rules can be shared across different projects via the Share API
   flag.
  </para>
  <para>
   Firewall rules supersede the Security Group rules that are applied at the
   Instance level for all traffic entering or leaving a private, project
   network.
