  <title>Integrating with Splunk</title>
  <para>
   The &kw-hos-phrase; logging solution provides a flexible and extensible
   framework to centralize the collection and processing of logs from all nodes
   in your cloud. The logs are shipped to a highly available and fault-tolerant
   cluster where they are transformed and stored for better searching and
   reporting. The &kw-hos-phrase; logging solution uses the ELK stack
   (&elasticsearch;, Logstash and Kibana) as a production-grade implementation
   and can support other storage and indexing technologies.

  <para>
   You can configure Logstash, the service that aggregates and forwards the
   logs to a searchable index, to send the logs to a third-party target, such
   as Splunk.

   For how to integrate the &kw-hos-phrase; centralized
   logging solution with Splunk, including the steps to set up and forward
   logs, please refer to <xref linkend="splunk_integration" />.
