 <title>Considerations When Installing Two Systems on One Subnet</title>
 <para>
  If you wish to install two separate &product; systems using a single
  subnet, you will need to consider the following notes.
 </para>
 <para>
  The <literal>ip_cluster</literal> service includes the
  <literal>keepalived</literal> daemon which maintains virtual IPs (VIPs) on
  cluster nodes. In order to maintain VIPs, it communicates between cluster
  nodes over the VRRP protocol.
 </para>
 <para>
  A VRRP virtual routerid identifies a particular VRRP cluster and must be
  unique for a subnet. If you have two VRRP clusters with the same virtual
  routerid, causing a clash of VRRP traffic, the VIPs are unlikely to be up or
  pingable and you are likely to get the following signature in your
  <literal>/etc/keepalived/keepalived.log</literal>:
 </para>
<screen><?dbsuse-fo font-size="0.65em"?>Dec 16 15:43:43 ardana-cp1-c1-m1-mgmt Keepalived_vrrp[2218]: ip address
  associated with VRID not present in received packet : 10.2.1.11
Dec 16 15:43:43 ardana-cp1-c1-m1-mgmt Keepalived_vrrp[2218]: one or more VIP
  associated with VRID mismatch actual MASTER advert
Dec 16 15:43:43 ardana-cp1-c1-m1-mgmt Keepalived_vrrp[2218]: bogus VRRP packet
  received on br-bond0 !!!
Dec 16 15:43:43 ardana-cp1-c1-m1-mgmt Keepalived_vrrp[2218]: VRRP_Instance(VI_2)
  ignoring received advertisment...</screen>
 <para>
  To resolve this issue, our recommendation is to install your separate
  &product; systems with VRRP traffic on different subnets.
 </para>
 <para>
  If this is not possible, you may also assign a unique routerid to your
  separate &product; system by changing the
  <literal>keepalived_vrrp_offset</literal> service configurable. The routerid
  is currently derived using the <literal>keepalived_vrrp_index</literal> which
  comes from a configuration processor variable and the
  <literal>keepalived_vrrp_offset</literal>.
 </para>
 <para>
  For example,
 </para>
 <procedure>
  <step>
   <para>
    Log in to your &clm;.
   </para>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>
    Edit your
    <filename>~/openstack/my_cloud/config/keepalived/defaults.yml</filename>
    file and change the value of the following line:
   </para>
<screen>keepalived_vrrp_offset: 0</screen>
   <para>
    Change the off value to a number that uniquely identifies a separate vrrp
    cluster. For example:
   </para>
   <para>
    <literal>keepalived_vrrp_offset: 0</literal> for the 1st vrrp cluster on
    this subnet.
   </para>
   <para>
    <literal>keepalived_vrrp_offset: 1</literal> for the 2nd vrrp cluster on
    this subnet.
   </para>
   <para>
    <literal>keepalived_vrrp_offset: 2</literal> for the 3rd vrrp cluster on
    this subnet.
   </para>
   <important xml:id="symlinks">
    <para>
     You should be aware that the files in the
     <filename>~/openstack/my_cloud/config/</filename> directory are symlinks
     to the <filename>~/openstack/ardana/ansible/</filename> directory. For
     example:
    </para>
<screen><?dbsuse-fo font-size="0.65em"?>&prompt.ardana;ls -al ~/openstack/my_cloud/config/keepalived/defaults.yml
lrwxrwxrwx 1 stack stack 55 May 24 20:38 /var/lib/ardana/openstack/my_cloud/config/keepalived/defaults.yml -&gt;
    ../../../ardana/ansible/roles/keepalived/defaults/main.yml
</screen>
    <para>
     If you are using a tool like <literal>sed</literal> to make edits to files
     in this directory, you might break the symbolic link and create a new copy
     of the file. To maintain the link, you will need to force
     <literal>sed</literal> to follow the link:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.ardana;sed -i <emphasis role="bold">--follow-symlinks</emphasis> \
  's$keepalived_vrrp_offset: 0$keepalived_vrrp_offset: 2$' \
  ~/openstack/my_cloud/config/keepalived/defaults.yml
</screen>
    <para>
     Alternatively, directly edit the target of the link
     <filename>~/openstack/ardana/ansible/roles/keepalived/defaults/main.yml</filename>.
    </para>
   </important>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>
    Commit your configuration to the Git repository (see
    <xref linkend="using_git"/>), as follows:
   </para>
<screen>&prompt.ardana;cd ~/openstack/ardana/ansible
&prompt.ardana;git add -A
&prompt.ardana;git commit -m "changing Admin password"</screen>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>
    Run the configuration processor with this command:
   </para>
<screen>&prompt.ardana;cd ~/openstack/ardana/ansible
&prompt.ardana;ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost config-processor-run.yml</screen>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>
    Use the playbook below to create a deployment directory:
   </para>
<screen>&prompt.ardana;cd ~/openstack/ardana/ansible
&prompt.ardana;ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost ready-deployment.yml</screen>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>
    If you are making this change after your initial install, run the following
    reconfigure playbook to make this change in your environment:
   </para>
<screen>&prompt.ardana;cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/ardana/ansible/
&prompt.ardana;ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts FND-CLU-reconfigure.yml</screen>
  </step>
 </procedure>
