 <para>
  <emphasis><guimenu>Servers</guimenu> have a <guimenu>server-role</guimenu>
  which determines how they will be used in the cloud.</emphasis>
 </para>
 <para>
  <guimenu>Servers</guimenu> (in the input model) enumerate the resources
  available for your cloud. In addition, in this definition file you can either
  provide &productname; with all of the details it needs to PXE boot and install an
  operating system onto the server, or, if you prefer to use your own operating
  system installation tooling you can simply provide the details needed to be
  able to SSH into the servers and start the deployment.
 </para>
 <para>
  The address specified for the server will be the one used by &productname; for
  lifecycle management and must be part of a network which is in the input
  model. If you are using &productname; to install the operating system this network
  must be an untagged VLAN. The first server must be installed manually from
  the &productname; ISO and this server must be included in the input model as well.
 </para>
 <para>
  In addition to the network details used to install or connect to the server,
  each server defines what its <guimenu>server-role</guimenu> is and to which
  <guimenu>server-group</guimenu> it belongs.
