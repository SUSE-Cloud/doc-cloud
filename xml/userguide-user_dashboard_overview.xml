 <title>Using the Dashboard</title>
 <para>
  Often referred to as Horizon or the Horizon dashboard, you can use this
  console to manage resources on a domain and project level in a web-based
  graphical user interface (GUI).
 </para>
 <para>
  Horizon is the OpenStack service that serves as the basis for the &kw-hos;
  dashboards.
 </para>
 <para>
  The dashboards provide a web-based user interface to &kw-hos; services
  including Compute, Volume Operations, Networking, and Identity.
 </para>
 <section xml:id="access.horizon">
  <title>Accessing Horizon</title>
  <para>
   To access the Horizon dashboard as a non cloud administrator, you should ask
   the cloud admin for the host name or public IP address of the dashboard, and
   for your user name and password. If you are a cloud admin, you can determine
   the URL and credentials by following the steps in
   <xref linkend="cloudadmin_gui"/>.
  </para>
  <note>
   <para>
    If you are authenticating against an external source such as an LDAP
    directory or via WebSSO you cannot change your password via the change
    password option in User settings.
   </para>
  </note>
  <para>
   Along the left side of the Horizon user interface are sections that provide
   access to Project and Settings sections. If your login credentials have been
   assigned the 'admin' role you will also see a separate Admin section that
   provides additional system-wide setting options.
  </para>
  <para>
   Across the top are menus to switch between projects and menus where you can
   access user settings.

    <note>
     <para>
      Administrators should be cautious to ensure that Horizon Extensions
      they install come from a trusted source and/or have undergone
      appropriate review and testing. Administrators should be aware of the
      risk of spear phishing, by which they may receive an offer to install
      an apparently useful application which also performs malicious actions.

    <para>
     <emphasis role="bold">Host aggregates </emphasis>are a grouping of
     physical servers or hosts with associated metadata. A host can belong to
     multiple aggregates.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Common use cases for host aggregates include supporting the scheduling of
     instances to a subset of hosts that have a specific capability or flavor
     such as a specific type of storage, lots of RAM, and/or large numbers of
     processors.
    </para>
    <para>
     Another use case of host aggregates is to support the arrangement of hosts
     into logical groups for load balancing and instance distribution. Host
     aggregates are configured and only viewable by system admins. The end user
     view of a host aggregate is called an Availability Zone. Availability
     zones are created via the Nova API and the host aggregates function. End
     users can use availability zones for similar use cases. For example, an
     application could be deployed on hosts in multiple availability zones. A
     load balancer can then be configured and the instances running each
     deployment of the application in each availability zone can be assigned to
     the load balancer thus providing a measure of failover and high
     availability support.

     <emphasis role="bold">The Volumes panel</emphasis> is displayed if the
     OpenStack Cinder service is available. Cinder provides block storage
     infrastructure. Block storage provides the ability for end users to attach
     storage as discrete drives to a compute instance. These drives are
     persistent and can be reassigned to a different instance. The Volumes tab
     on this view shows all currently created volumes and associated metadata
     and status, which physical host the volume is hosted on, and the ability
     for the admin to manage each volume.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     <emphasis role="bold">Flavors</emphasis> are virtual hardware templates.
     Flavors are used to define a virtual compute host. Flavors are assigned
     during the creation of a new instance. This panel displays all of the
     current flavor types and provides the ability for the admin to create,
     edit or delete flavors. Hosting organizations often use flavors as a form
     of billing unit; flavors with more resources are charged at a higher rate
     than flavors with fewer resources.
