 <title>Network Tags</title>
 <para>
  Network tags are defined by some &kw-hos;
  <guimenu>service-components</guimenu> and are used to convey information
  between the network model and the service, allowing the dependent aspects of
  the service to be automatically configured.
  <!--For example, an option in a service configuration file that needs the
  IP address of the corresponding network device on a server where that
  service-component is installed.-->
 </para>
 <para>
  Network tags also convey requirements a service may have for aspects of the
  server network configuration, for example, that a bridge is required on the
  corresponding network device on a server where that service-component is
  installed.

  See <xref linkend="configobj-networktags"/> for more information on specific
  tags and their usage.
