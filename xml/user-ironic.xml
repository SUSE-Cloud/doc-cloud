    <title>Ironic User Guide</title>
      <para>Ironic is an OpenStack project which provisions bare metal (as opposed to
            virtual) machines. It may be used independently or as part of an OpenStack
            Cloud, and integrates with the OpenStack Identity (keystone), Compute (nova),
            Network (neutron), Image (glance) and Object (swift) services.</para>
      <para>When the Bare Metal service is appropriately configured with the Compute and
            Network services, it is possible to provision both virtual and physical
            machines through the Compute service’s API. However, the set of instance
            actions is limited, arising from the different characteristics of physical
            servers and switch hardware. For example, live migration can not be performed
            on a bare metal instance.</para>
      <para>The community maintains reference drivers that leverage open-source
            technologies (for example, PXE and IPMI) to cover a wide range of hardware. Ironic’s
            pluggable driver architecture also allows hardware vendors to write and
            contribute drivers that may improve performance or add functionality not
            provided by the community drivers.</para>

        <para>The diagram below shows the logical architecture. It shows the basic
                components that form the Ironic service, the relation of Ironic service with
                other OpenStack services and the logical flow of a boot instance request

        <para>The Ironic service is composed of the following components:</para>
        <procedure>
          <step>
            <para>A RESTful API service, by which operators and other services may interact

          </step>
          <step>
            <para>A conductor service, which does the bulk of the work. Functionality is
                  exposed via the API service. The Conductor and API services communicate
                  via RPC.</para>

          <step>
            <para>A database for storing information about the resources. Among other things,
                  this includes the state of the conductors, nodes (physical servers), and
                  drivers.</para>
          </step>
        </procedure>
        <para>As in Figure 1.2. Logical Architecture, a user request to boot an instance is
                passed to the Nova Compute service via Nova API and Nova Scheduler. The Compute
                service hands over this request to the Ironic service, where the request passes
                from the Ironic API, to the Conductor, to a driver to successfully provision a
                physical server for the user.</para>
        <para>Just as the Nova Compute service talks to various OpenStack services like
                Glance, Neutron, or Swift to provision a virtual machine instance, here the
                Ironic service talks to the same OpenStack services for image, network and
                other resource needs to provision a bare metal instance.</para>

          <title>Preboot Execution Environment (PXE)</title>
          <para>PXE is part of the Wired for Management (WfM) specification developed by Intel
                    and Microsoft. The PXE enables system’s BIOS and network interface card (NIC)
                    to bootstrap a computer from the network in place of a disk. Bootstrapping is
                    the process by which a system loads the OS into local memory so that it can be
                    executed by the processor. This capability of allowing a system to boot over a
                    network simplifies server deployment and server management for administrators.</para>

          <title>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)</title>
          <para>DHCP is a standardized networking protocol used on Internet Protocol (IP)
                    networks for dynamically distributing network configuration parameters, such
                    as IP addresses for interfaces and services. Using PXE, the BIOS uses DHCP to
                    obtain an IP address for the network interface and to locate the server that
                    stores the network bootstrap program (NBP).</para>

        <section xml:id="network-bootstrap-program-nbp">
          <title>Network Bootstrap Program (NBP)</title>
          <para>NBP is equivalent to GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader) or LILO (LInux LOader) -
                    loaders which are traditionally used in local booting. Like the boot program
                    in a hard drive environment, the NBP is responsible for loading the OS kernel
                    into memory so that the OS can be bootstrapped over a network.</para>

          <para>TFTP is a simple file transfer protocol that is generally used for automated
                    transfer of configuration or boot files between machines in a local
                    environment.  In a PXE environment, TFTP is used to download NBP over the
                    network using information from the DHCP server.</para>

          <para>IPMI is a standardized computer system interface used by system administrators
                    for out-of-band management of computer systems and monitoring of their
                    operation. It is a method to manage systems that may be unresponsive or powered
                    off by using only a network connection to the hardware rather than to an
                    operating system.</para>

        <title>Ironic Deployment Architecture</title>
        <para>The Ironic RESTful API service is used to enroll hardware that Ironic will
                manage. A cloud administrator usually registers the hardware, specifying their
                attributes such as MAC addresses and IPMI credentials. There can be multiple
                instances of the API service.</para>
        <para>The Ironic conductor service does the bulk of the work.
                For security reasons, it is advisable to place the conductor service on
                an isolated host, since it is the only service that requires access to both
                the data plane and IPMI control plane.</para>
        <para>There can be multiple instances of the conductor service to support
                various class of drivers and also to manage fail over. Instances of the
                conductor service should be on separate nodes. Each conductor can itself run
                many drivers to operate heterogeneous hardware. This is depicted in the
                following figure.</para>
