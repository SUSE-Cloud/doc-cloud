 <title>Configuring the Metrics Agent</title>
 <para>
  The installation of the Metrics Agent includes its initial configuration. To
  prepare the environment for application operators, you have to reconfigure
  the agent. It is necessary to explicitly activate the libvirt metrics that
  the application operators use for monitoring.
 </para>
 <para>
  To reconfigure the agent, proceed as follows:
 </para>
 <orderedlist>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Activate the libvirt metrics. For details on activating additional metrics,
    refer to <xref linkend="idg-shared-install-c-configuremetagent-xml-1"/>.
    For an example configuration, refer to
    <xref linkend="idg-shared-appendix-r-metricsadditional-xml-1"/>.

    Make sure that the host name specified for the
    <literal>nova-compute</literal> service is specified in the
    <literal>agent.yaml</literal> configuration file.
   </para>
   <para>
    To check the host name for the <literal>nova-compute</literal> service, you
    can execute the following command:
