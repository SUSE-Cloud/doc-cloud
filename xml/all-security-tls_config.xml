            reside on the server and CA certificates reside on the client. A server certificate
            affirms that the server that sent it serves a set of IP addresses, domain names, and set
            of services. A CA certificate is used by the client to authenticate this claim. </para>

      </variablelist><para>The major difference between an external VIP certificate and an internal VIP certificate is
        that the internal VIP has approximately 40 domain names in the SAN. This is because each
        service has a different domain name in &kw-hos-phrase;. So it is
        unlikely that you can create an internal server certificate before running the configuration
        processor. But after a configuration processor run, a certificate request would be created
        for each of your cert-names.</para>
</sidebar>
    <sidebar><title>Configuring TLS in the input model</title><para>For this example certificate configuration, let's assume there's no FQDN for the external
        VIP and that you're going to use the default IP address provided by &kw-hos-phrase;. Let's also assume that for the internal VIP you will use the
        defaults as well. If you were to call your certificate authority "example-CA," the CA
        certificate would then be called "example-CA.crt" and the key would be called
        "example-CA.key." In the following examples, the external VIP certificate will be named
        "example-public-cert" and the internal VIP certificate will be named
        "example-internal-cert."</para>

    <para> When you bring in your own certificate, you may want to bring in the trust chains (or
      CA certificate) for this certificate. This is usually not required if the CA is a public

    <sidebar><title>Turning TLS on or off</title><para> You should leave TLS enabled in production.
      However, if you need to disable it for any reason, you must change "tls-components" to
      "components" in <literal>network_groups.yml</literal> (as shown earlier) and comment out the
      cert-file. Additionally, if you have a <literal>network_groups.yml</literal> file from a
      previous installation, you won't have TLS enabled unless you change "components" to
      "tls-components" in that file. By default, Horizon is configured with TLS in the input model.
      Note that you should not disable TLS in the input model for Horizon as that is a public
      endpoint and is required. Additionally, you should keep all services behind TLS, but using the
      input model file <literal>network_groups.yml</literal> you may turn TLS off for a service for
      troubleshooting or debugging. TLS should always be enabled for production environments.</para>
<para>If
        you are using an example input model on a clean install, all supported TLS services will be
        enabled before deployment of your cloud. If you want to change this setting later, for
        example, when upgrading, you can change the input model and reconfigure the system. The
        process is as follows:</para>
<para>Edit the input model <literal>network_groups.yml</literal> file
      appropriately, as described above. Then, commit the changes to the git
      repository:</para>
