 <title>&rhla; Pre-Installation Checks</title>
 <para>
  When provisioning a &rh; compute node, you should be aware of the
  below issues and take any appropriate steps for your environmnet.

 <section>
  <title>Sample iptables rules must be removed on &rh;</title>
  <para>
   &product; uses iptables to secure access to &clm; network
   interfaces and on &rh; this requires the package
   <literal>iptables-services</literal> to be installed. The package will
   provide sample iptables configurations for IPv4 and IPv6 if none existed
   before. This sample configuration is inappropriate for &productname; operation
   and the node will not be able to run &productname; with these rules installed.
  </para>
  <para>
   The files installed are:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     <filename>/etc/sysconfig/iptables</filename>
    </para>

    <para>
     <filename>/etc/sysconfig/ip6tables</filename>

  <para>
   If these files <emphasis role="bold">do not exist</emphasis> on the
   candidate &rh; systems, the rest of this note may be skipped.
   However, if these files do exist, there are a number of steps that you must
   follow before you install &product;.

   The default contents of these two files are displayed here for reference:

   By default, these rules are applied to network traffic on <emphasis>all
   interfaces</emphasis> on the system, whereas &productname; components and OpenStack
   components manage <emphasis>interface-specific</emphasis> rules. With
   reference to the security policies that you may require for your
   environment, it is essential that you either:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Delete the files <filename>/etc/sysconfig/iptables</filename> and
     <filename>/etc/sysconfig/ip6tables</filename> so that they do not
     interfere with the new rules that will be applied during the &productname;
     installation.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Or, if certain rules are necessary in your environment, ensure that any
     remaining rules are limited to interfaces not used by &productname;.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <important>
   <para>
    If these files existed on your system, and did contain content, the
    corresponding rules are currently installed and active on the system. Once
    you delete these two files (or edit them to limit the rules to interfaces
    not used by &productname;), you will need to reboot the system to activate the
    new settings.

  <title>Cobbler Support Removed</title>
  <para>
   Cobbler support for deploying &rhel; compute nodes has been removed. Use
   your normal &rhel; deployment tools instead of the deprecated Cobbler
   support.
