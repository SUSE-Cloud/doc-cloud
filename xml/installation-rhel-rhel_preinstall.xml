 <title>&rhla; Pre-Installation Checks</title>
 <para>
  As part of the preparation to provision a &rh; compute node you need to be
  aware of the issues raised in this article and take any remedial action
  required.
 </para>
 <section>
  <title>Sample iptables rules must be removed on &rh;</title>
  <para>
   &kw-hos-phrase; uses iptables to secure access to &lcm; network
   interfaces and on &rh; this requires the package
   <literal>iptables-services</literal> to be installed. The package will
   provide sample iptables configurations for IPv4 and IPv6 if none existed
   before. This sample configuration is inappropriate for &kw-hos; operation
   and the node will not be able to run &hpecloud; with these rules installed.
  </para>
  <para>
   The files installed are:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     <filename>/etc/sysconfig/iptables</filename>
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     <filename>/etc/sysconfig/ip6tables</filename>
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>
   If these files <emphasis role="bold">do not exist</emphasis> on the
   candidate &rh; systems the rest of this note may be skipped as the
   &kw-hos-phrase; install will prevent the installation of the sample files.
   However, if these files do exist, there are a number of steps that you must
   follow before you install &kw-hos-phrase;.

   These rules are applied to network traffic on <emphasis>any
   interface</emphasis> on the system whereas &kw-hos; components and OpenStack
   components manage <emphasis>interface specific</emphasis> rules. With
   reference to the security policies that you may require for your
   environment, it is essential that you either:

    <para>
     Delete the files <filename>/etc/sysconfig/iptables</filename> and
     <filename>/etc/sysconfig/ip6tables</filename> as none of the contained
     rules are required.
    </para>
   </listitem>

     Ensure that any remaining rules are limited to interfaces not used by
     &kw-hos;.

  <important>
   <para>
    If these files existed on your system, and did contain content, the
    corresponding rules are currently installed and active on the system. Once
    you delete these two files (or edit them to limit the rules to interfaces
    not used by &kw-hos;), you will need to reboot the system to activate the
    new settings.
