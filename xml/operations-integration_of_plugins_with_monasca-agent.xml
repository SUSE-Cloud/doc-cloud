 <title>Openstack Integration of Custom Plugins into Monasca-Agent (if applicable)</title>
 <para>
  Monasca-agent is an OpenStack open-source project. Monasca can also monitor
  non-openstack services. Third parties should install custom plugins into
  their &product; system using the steps outlined in the
  <xref linkend="writing_custom_plugins"/>. If the OpenStack community
  determines that the custom plugins are of general benefit, the plugin may be
  added to the openstack/monasca-agent so that they are installed with the
  monasca-agent. During the review process for openstack/monasca-agent there
  are no guarantees that code will be approved or merged by a deadline.
  Open-source contributors are expected to help with codereviews in order to get
  their code accepted. Once changes are approved and integrated into the
  openstack/monasca-agent and that version of the monasca-agent is integrated
  with &product;, the third party can remove the custom plugin
  installation steps since they would be installed in the default monasca-agent
  venv.
