    When exporting a LUN to a node for boot from SAN, you should ensure that
    <emphasis>LUN 0</emphasis> is assigned to the LUN and configure any setup

   Boot from SAN support using QLogic-based FlexFabric adapters is latent in <keyword keyref="kw-hos-phrase"/> but
   our testing has shown an issue which we were unable to address by the 3.0 release date and therefore we advise
   <keyword keyref="kw-hos-phrase"/> customers to not use that configuration. The aim is to fix this outstanding
   issue in a patch to <keyword keyref="kw-hos-phrase"/> in the near future. This issue also affects the use of QLogic

   To allow &kw-hos-phrase; to use volumes from a SAN, you have to specify

   Since NIC mapping is not used to guarantee order of the networks across the
   system the installer will remap the network interfaces in a deterministic
   fashion as part of the install. As part of the installer dialogue, if DHCP
   is not configured for the interface, it is necessary to confirm that the
   appropriate interface is assigned the ip address. The network interfaces may
   not be at the names expected when installing via an ISO. When you are asked
   to apply an IP address to an interface, press <keycombo>
   <keycap function="alt"/> <keycap>F2</keycap> </keycombo> and in the console
   window, run the command <command>ip a</command> to examine the interfaces
   and their associated MAC addresses. Make a note of the interface name with
   the expected MAC address and use this in the subsequent dialog. Press
   <keycombo> <keycap function="alt"/> <keycap>F1</keycap> </keycombo> to
   return to the installation screen. You should note that the names of the
   interfaces may have changed after the installation completes. These names
   are used consistently in any subsequent operations.
  </para>
<!-- FIXME: The following was commented in the DITA original: -->
<!-- You can check the mac addresses at this point by pressing
  <keycombo><keycap function="alt"/><keycap>F2</keycap></keycombo> and querying
  the interface assignment via <command>ip a</command>.
  <keycombo><keycap function="alt"/><keycap>F1</keycap></keycombo> will return to the installer
  dialogue. It may be that, as part of the install, the ip is transferred to
  the <quote>reordered</quote> name. -->

   Therefore, even if FCoE is not used for boot from SAN (for example for
   cinder), then it is recommended that <literal>fcoe-interfaces</literal> be
   specified as part of install (without the multipath or disk detect options).
   Alternatively, you need to run
   <filename>osconfig-fcoe-reorder.yml</filename> before
   <filename>site.yml</filename> or <filename>osconfig-run.yml</filename> is
   invoked to reorder the networks in a similar manner to the installer. In
   this case, the nodes will need to be manually rebooted for the network
   reorder to take effect. Run <filename>osconfig-fcoe-reorder.yml</filename>
   in the following scenarios:

   import the LUNs before this, for instance, in scenarios where you need to
   run <filename>wipe_disks.yml</filename> (run this only after first running
   <filename>bm-reimage.yml</filename>), then you can run the
   <literal>fcoe-enable</literal> playbook across the nodes in question. This

  <title>Installing the &kw-hos-phrase; ISO for Nodes That Support Boot From SAN</title>
  <procedure>
   <step>
    <para>
     During manual installation of &cloudos;, select the desired SAN disk and
     create an LVM partitioning scheme that meets &productname; requirements,
     that is it has an <literal>ardana-vg</literal> volume group and an
     <literal>ardana-vg-root</literal> logical volume. For further information
     on partitioning, see
     <xref
      linkend="sec.depl.adm_inst.partitioning"/>.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     After the installation is completed and the system is booted up, open the
     file <filename>/etc/multipath.conf</filename> and edit the defaults as
     follows:
    </para>
<screen>defaults {
    user_friendly_names yes
    bindings_file "/etc/multipath/bindings"
}</screen>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Open the <filename>/etc/multipath/bindings</filename> file and map the
     expected device name to the SAN disk selected during installation. In
     &productname;, the naming convention is <literal>mpatha</literal>,
     <literal>mpathb</literal>, and so on. For example:

     Reboot the machine to enable the changes.
