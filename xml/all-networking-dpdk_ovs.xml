    <sidebar><title>What is OVS-DPDK?</title><para>
        &kw-hos-phrase; uses an updated Open vSwitch (OVS) that is built with the
        Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) and includes a QEMU hypervisor which supports
        vhost-user.</para>
<para>The OVS-DPDK package modifes the OVS fast path, which is normally performed in kernel
        space, and allows it to run in userspace so there is no context switch to the kernel for
        processing network packets.</para>
<para>The EAL component of DPDK supports mapping the Network Interface Card (NIC) registers
        directly into userspace. The DPDK provides a Poll Mode Driver (PMD) that can access the NIC
        hardware from userspace and uses polling instead of interrupts to avoid the user to kernel
        transition.</para>
<para>The PMD maps the shared address space of the VM that is provided by the vhost-user
        capability of QEMU. The vhost-user mode causes Neutron to create a Unix domain socket that
        allows communication between the PMD and QEMU. The PMD uses this in order to acquire the
        file descriptors to the pre-allocated VM memory. This allows the PMD to directly access the
        VM memory space and perform a fast zero-copy of network packets directly into and out of the
        VMs virtio_net vring.</para>
<para>This yields performance improvements in the time it takes to process network packets.</para>
</sidebar>
    <sidebar><title>Usage considerations</title><para>The target for a DPDK Open vSwitch is VM performance and VMs only run on compute nodes so
        the following considerations are compute node specific.</para>
<orderedlist xml:id="ol_pmz_yjf_qw">
        <listitem><para>You are required to <xref linkend="hugepages"/> in
          order to use DPDK with VMs. The memory to be used must be allocated at boot time so you
          must know beforehand how many VMs will be scheduled on a node. Also, for NUMA
          considerations, you want those hugepages on the same NUMA node as the NIC. A VM maps its
          entire address space into a hugepage.</para>
</listitem>
        <listitem><para>For maximum performance you must reserve logical cores for DPDK poll mode driver (PMD)
          usage and for hypervisor (QEMU) usage. This keeps the Linux kernel from scheduling
          processes on those cores. The PMD threads will go to 100% cpu utilization since it uses
          polling of the hardware instead of interrupts. There will be at least 2 cores dedicated to
          PMD threads. Each VM will have a core dedicated to it although for less performance VMs
          can share cores.</para>
</listitem>
        <listitem><para>VMs can use the virtio_net or the virtio_pmd drivers. There is also a PMD for an
          emulated e1000.</para>
</listitem>
        <listitem><para>Only VMs that use hugepages can be sucessfully launched on a DPDK enabled NIC. If there
          is a need to support both DPDK and non-DPDK based VMs an additional port managed by the
          Linux kernel must exist.</para>
</listitem>
        <listitem><para>OVS/DPDK does not support jumbo frames. Please review <link xlink:href="https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs/blob/branch-2.5/INSTALL.DPDK.md#restrictions">https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs/blob/branch-2.5/INSTALL.DPDK.md#restrictions</link> for restrictions.</para>
</listitem>
        <listitem><para>The Open vSwitch firewall driver in networking-ovs-dpdk repo is stateless and not a
          stateful one that would use iptables and conntrack. In the past, Neutron core has declined
          to pull in stateless type FW. <link xlink:href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1531205">https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1531205</link>
          The native firewall driver is stateful, which is why conntrack was added to Open vSwitch.
          But this is not supported on DPDK and won't be until OVS 2.6.</para>
