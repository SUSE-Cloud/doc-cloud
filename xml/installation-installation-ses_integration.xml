 <title>&ses; Integration</title>
 <para>
  The current version of &productname; supports integration with
  &ses;. Integrating &ses; enables &ceph; block storage as well as object
  and image storage services in &productname;.

  <title>Enabling &ses; Integration</title>
  <para>
   The &ses; integration is provided through the
   <package>ardana-ses</package> RPM package. As this package is
   included in the <systemitem>patterns-cloud-ardana</systemitem> pattern, its
   installation is covered in <xref linkend="cha.depl.dep_inst"/>.

  <title>Configuration</title>
  <para>
   After the &ses; integration package has been installed, it must be
   configured in order to work. Files that contain relevant &ses;/&ceph;
   deployment information must be placed into a directory on the deployer
   node. This includes the configuration file that describes various aspects of
   the &ceph; environment as well as keyrings for each user and pool created in
   the &ceph; environment. In addition to that, you need to edit the
   <filename>settings.yml</filename> file to enable the &ses; integration to
   run and update all of the &productname; service configuration files.
  </para>
  <para>
   The <filename>settings.yml</filename> file must reside in the
  <filename>~/openstack/my_cloud/config/ses/</filename> directory. Open the
  file for editing, uncomment the <literal>ses_config_path:</literal>
  parameter, and specify the location on the deployer host containing the
  <filename>ses_config.yml</filename> and keyring files as the parameter's
  value. After you have done that, the <filename>site.yml</filename> and
  <filename>ardana-reconfigure.yml</filename> playbooks activates the &ses;
  integration and configures the &o_blockstore;, &o_img;, and &o_comp; services.
  </para>
   <para>
    For &ceph;, it is necessary to create pools and users to allow the &productname;
    services to use the &ses;/&ceph; cluster. Pools and users must be created
    for &o_blockstore;, &o_blockstore; backup, &o_comp; and &o_img;. After the
    required pools and users are set up on the &ses;/&ceph; cluster, you have to
    create a <filename>ses_config.yml</filename> configuration file (see the
    example below). This file
    is used during deployment to configure all of the services. The
    <filename>ses_config.yml</filename> and the keyring files should be placed
    in a separate directory. The path to this directory must be specified in the
    <filename>settings.yml</filename> file.
