    <sidebar xml:id="capacity_reporting_overview"><para>Capacity reporting is a new feature in &kw-hos-phrase; which will
        provide cloud operators an overall capacity (available, used and remaining) information
        via the ops console so that the cloud operator can ensure that cloud resource pools
        have sufficient capacity to meet demands of users.  Cloud operator would also be
        able to set thresholds and set alarms so that he gets notified when the thresholds
        are met.
