    (AO)</title>
    <sidebar><para>VSA may be deployed with adaptive optimization (AO) or without AO. AO allows built-in
        storage tiering for VSA. While deploying VSA with or without AO you must ensure to use the
        appropriate disk input model.</para>
<para>If you are using VSA with AO, you will have an extra device group section where the usage
        is identified as adaptive-optimization as described in the following example:
        </para>
<screen >Additional disks can be added if available
          device_groups:
            - name: vsa-data
              consumer:
                name: vsa
                usage: data
              devices:
                - name: /dev/sdc
          - name: /dev/sdd
          - name: /dev/sde
          - name: /dev/sdf
          
            - name: vsa-cache
              consumer:
                name: vsa
                usage: <emphasis role="bold">adaptive-optimization</emphasis>
              devices:
                - name: /dev/sdb</screen>
<para>VSA without AO consists of only data disks as described in the following example:
        </para>
<screen >Additional disks can be added if available
              device_groups:
                - name: vsa-data
                  consumer:
                    name: vsa
                    usage: data
                  devices:
                    - name: /dev/sdc
                    - name: /dev/sdd
                    - name: /dev/sde
