 <title>Refining Access Control with AppArmor</title>
 <para>
  AppArmor is a Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system as opposed to a
  discretionary access control system. It is a kernel-level security module for
  Linux that controls access to low-level resources based on rights granted via
  policies to a program rather than to a user role. It enforces rules at the
  lowest software layer (the kernel level) preventing software from
  circumventing resource restrictions that reside at levels above the kernel.
  With AppArmor, the final gatekeeper is closest to the hardware.
 </para>
 <para>
  Controlling resource access per application versus per user role allows you
  to enforce rules based on specifically what a program can do versus trying to
  create user roles that are broad enough yet specific enough to apply to a
  group of users. In addition, it prevents the trap of having to predict all
  possible vulnerabilities in order to be secure.
 </para>
 <para>
  AppArmor uses a hybrid of whitelisting and blacklisting rules, and its
  security policies are/can be cascading, permitting inheritance from different
  or more general policies. Policies are enforced on a per-process basis.
 </para>
 <para>
  AppArmor also lets you tie a process to a CPU core if you want, and set
  process priority.
 </para>
 <para>
  AppArmor profiles are loaded into the kernel, typically on boot. They can run
  in either enforcement or complain modes. In enforcement mode, the policy is
  enforced and policy violation attempts are reported. In complain mode, policy
  violation attempts are reported but not prevented.

  <title>AppArmor in &product;</title>
  <para>
   At this time, AppArmor is not enabled by default in &product;.
   However, we recommend enabling it for key virtualization processes on
   compute nodes. For more information, see the
