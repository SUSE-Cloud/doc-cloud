 <title>Monasca Monitoring Integration Overview</title>
 <para>
  Monasca, the &kw-hos-phrase; monitoring service, collects information about
  your cloud's systems, and allows you to create alarm definitions based on
  these measurements. Monasca-agent is the component that collects metrics such
  as metric storage and alarm thresholding and forwards them to the monasca-api
  for further processing.
 </para>
 <para>
  With a small amount of configuration, you can use the detection and check
  plugins that are provided with your cloud to monitor integrated third-party
  components. In addition, you can write custom plugins and integrate them with
  the existing monitoring service.
