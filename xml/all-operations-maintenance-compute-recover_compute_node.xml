        following:</para>
<itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>The node has failed, either because it has shut down has a hardware failure, or for
          another reason.</para>
</listitem>
        <listitem><para>The node is working but the <literal>nova-compute</literal> process is not responding,
          thus instances are working but you cannot manage them (for example to delete, reboot, and
          attach/detach volumes).</para>
</listitem>
        <listitem><para>The node is fully operational but monitoring indicates a potential issue (such as disk
          errors) that require down time to fix.</para>
