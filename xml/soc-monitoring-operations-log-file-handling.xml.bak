 <title>Log File Handling</title>
 <para>
  In case of trouble with the <phrase>SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</phrase>
  services, you can study their log files to find the reason. The log files are
  also useful if you need to contact your support organization. For storing the
  log files, the default installation uses the <literal>/var/log</literal>
  directory on the hosts where the agents or services are installed.
 </para>
 <para>
  You can use <literal>systemd</literal>, a system and session manager for
  LINUX, and <literal>journald</literal>, a LINUX logging interface, for
  addressing dispersed log files.
 </para>
 <para>
  The <phrase>SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</phrase> installer automatically
  puts all <phrase>SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</phrase> services under the
  control of <literal>systemd</literal>. <literal>journald</literal> provides a
  centralized management solution for the logging of all processes that are
  controlled by <literal>systemd</literal>. The logs are collected and managed
  in a so-called journal controlled by the <literal>journald</literal> daemon.
