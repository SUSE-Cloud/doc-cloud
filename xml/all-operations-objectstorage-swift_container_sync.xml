    Sync</title>
    <!---->
    <sidebar xml:id="idg-all-operations-objectstorage-swift_container_sync-xml-4"><para>Swift has a feature where all the contents of a container can be mirrored to another
        container through background synchronization. Swift operators configure their system to
        allow/accept sync requests to/from other systems, and the user specifies where to sync their
        container to along with a secret synchronization key. For an overview of this feature, refer
        to <link xlink:href="http://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/overview_container_sync.html">OpenStack Swift - Container to Container
          Synchronization</link>.</para>
</sidebar>
    <sidebar xml:id="idg-all-operations-objectstorage-swift_container_sync-xml-5"><title>Notes and limitations</title><para>The container synchronization is done as a background action. When you put an object into
        the source container, it will take some time before it becomes visible in the destination
        container. Storage services will not necessarily copy objects in any particular order,
        meaning they may be transferred in a different order to which they were created.</para>
<para>Container sync may not be able to keep up with a moderate upload rate to a container. For
        example, if the average object upload rate to a container is greater than one object per
        second, then container sync may not be able to keep the objects synced.</para>
<para>If container sync is enabled on a container that already has a large number of objects then
        container sync may take a long time to sync the data. For example, a container with one
        million 1KB objects could take more than 11 days to complete a sync.</para>
<para>You may operate on the destination container just like any other container -- adding or
        deleting objects -- including the objects that are in the destination container because they
        were copied from the source container. To decide how to handle object creation, replacement
        or deletion, the system uses timestamps to determine what to do. In general, the latest
        timestamp "wins" i.e., if you create an object, replace it, delete it and the re-create it,
        the destination container will eventually contain the most recently created object. However,
        if you also create and delete objects in the destination container, you get some subtle
        behaviours as follows:</para>
<itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>If an object is copied to the destination container and then deleted, it remains deleted
          in the destination even though there is still a copy in the source container. If you
          modify the object (replace or change its metadata) in the source container, it will
          reappear in the destination again.</para>
</listitem>
        <listitem><para>The same applies to a replacement or metadata modification of an object in the
          destination container -- the object will remain as-is unless there is a replacement or
          modification in the source container.</para>
</listitem>
        <listitem><para>If you replace or modify metadata of an object in the destination container and then
          delete it in the source container, it is <emphasis role="bold">not</emphasis> deleted from the destination. This is
          because your modified object has a later timestamp than the object you deleted in the
          source.</para>
</listitem>
        <listitem><para>If you create an object in the source container and before the system has a chance to
          copy it to the destination, you also create an object of the same name in the destination,
          then the object in the destination is <emphasis role="bold">not</emphasis> overwritten by the source container's
          object.</para>
</listitem>
      </itemizedlist><para><para><emphasis role="bold">Segmented objects</emphasis></para><para>Segmented objects (objects larger than 5GB) will not work seamlessly with container
          synchronization. If the manifest object is copied to the destination container before the
          object segments, when you perform a GET operation on the manifest object, the system may
          fail to find some or all of the object segments. If your manifest and object segments are
          in different containers, don't forget that both containers must be synchonized and that
          the container name of the object segments must be the same on both source and
          destination.</para></para>
