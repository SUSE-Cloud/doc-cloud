 <title>NIC Mapping</title>
 <para>
  When a <guimenu>server</guimenu> has more than a single physical network
  port, a <guimenu>nic-mapping</guimenu> is required to unambiguously identify
  each port. Standard Linux mapping of ports to interface names at the time of
  initial discovery (for example, <literal>eth0</literal>,
  <literal>eth1</literal>, <literal>eth2</literal>, ...) is not uniformly
  consistent
  from server to server, so a mapping of PCI bus address to interface name is
  instead.
 </para>
 <para>
  NIC mappings are also used to specify the device type for interfaces that are
  to be used for SR-IOV or PCI Passthrough. Each &kw-hos; release includes the
  data for the supported device types.
