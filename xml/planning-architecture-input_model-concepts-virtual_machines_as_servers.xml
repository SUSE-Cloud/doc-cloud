    <para>Starting in [[[kw-hos-phrase]]], servers can be configured as hypervisors which host 
        virtual machines that are can be defined, instantiated and configured as servers for hosting 
        [[[kw-hos]]] services.  Both the hypervisors and the VMs are treated as “servers” 
        within the input model with additional attributes to define the relationship.</para>
<para>To define a hypervisor in the input model:</para>
<itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>Set the attribute <literal>hlm-hypervisor: true</literal> for the server.</para>
</listitem>
        <listitem><para>Define how network groups that are needed by the VMs will be mapped to the 
          hypervisor’s interfaces by adding <literal>passthrough-network-groups</literal> to the interface model of the hypervisor.</para>
</listitem>
        
      </itemizedlist><para>To define a virtual machine server in the input model:</para>
<itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>Create a server object that includes the <literal>hypervisor-id</literal> attribute.  
          This indicates that the server is a virtual machine, and also identifies 
          the physical server that will host the VM.</para>
</listitem>
        <listitem><para>Specify virtual machine CPU sizing information in the server’s CPU model.</para>
</listitem>
        <listitem><para>Specify virtual machine memory sizing information in the server’s memory model.</para>
</listitem>
        <listitem><para>Specify virtual machine disk sizing information in the server’s disk model.</para>
</listitem>
        <listitem><para>Specify the virtual machine’s network devices in the server’s nic-mappings object.</para>
</listitem>
        
      </itemizedlist><para>Given the above information, [[[kw-hos]]] will configure the hypervisors 
        and create thea virtual machines running the HPE Linux operating system.  Subsequent configuration 
        of the virtual machine’s operating system, and installation and configuration of [[[kw-hos]]] 
        services on that virtual machine server, use the same lifecycle management mechanisms as physical servers.</para>
<para>Note that a hypervisor can still be used to run [[[kw-hos]]]  services, so for example 
        a server can be both running VMs (that in turn are running API services, MySQL, etc) and also be running services 
        that are better not virtualized such as Swift, VSA, etc.</para>
