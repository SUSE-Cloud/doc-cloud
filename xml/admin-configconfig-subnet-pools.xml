  <title>Subnet pools</title>
  <para>Subnet pools have been made available since the Kilo release. It is a simple
            feature that has the potential to improve your workflow considerably. It also
            provides a building block from which other new features will be built in to
            OpenStack Networking.</para>
  <para>To see if your cloud has this feature available, you can check that it is
            listed in the supported aliases. You can do this with the OpenStack client.</para>
  <screen language="console"><?dbsuse-fo font-size="8pt"?>$ openstack extension list | grep subnet_allocation
| Subnet Allocation | subnet_allocation | Enables allocation of subnets
from a subnet pool                                                                                                         |</screen>

    <title>Why you need them</title>
    <para>Before Kilo, Networking had no automation around the addresses used to create a
                subnet. To create one, you had to come up with the addresses on your own
                without any help from the system. There are valid use cases for this but if you
                are interested in the following capabilities, then subnet pools might be for
                you.</para>
    <para>First, would not it be nice if you could turn your pool of addresses over to
                Neutron to take care of?  When you need to create a subnet, you just ask for
                addresses to be allocated from the pool. You do not have to worry about what
                you have already used and what addresses are in your pool. Subnet pools can do
                this.</para>
    <para>Second, subnet pools can manage addresses across projects. The addresses are
                guaranteed not to overlap. If the addresses come from an externally routable
                pool then you know that all of the projects have addresses which are <emphasis>routable</emphasis>
                and unique. This can be useful in the following scenarios.</para>
    <procedure>
      <step>
        <para>IPv6 since OpenStack Networking has no IPv6 floating IPs.</para>
      </step>
      <step>
        <para>Routing directly to a project network from an external network.</para>
      </step>
    </procedure>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>How they work</title>
    <para>A subnet pool manages a pool of addresses from which subnets can be allocated.
                It ensures that there is no overlap between any two subnets allocated from the
                same pool.</para>
    <para>As a regular project in an OpenStack cloud, you can create a subnet pool of
                your own and use it to manage your own pool of addresses. This does not require
                any admin privileges. Your pool will not be visible to any other project.</para>
    <para>If you are an admin, you can create a pool which can be accessed by any regular
                project. Being a shared resource, there is a quota mechanism to arbitrate
                access.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Quotas</title>
    <para>Subnet pools have a quota system which is a little bit different than
                other quotas in Neutron. Other quotas in Neutron count discrete
                instances of an object against a quota. Each time you create something
                like a router, network, or a port, it uses one from your total quota.</para>
    <para>With subnets, the resource is the IP address space. Some subnets take
                more of it than others. For example, 203.0.113.0/24 uses 256 addresses
                in one subnet but 198.51.100.224/28 uses only 16. If address space is
                limited, the quota system can encourage efficient use of the space.</para>
    <para>With IPv4, the default_quota can be set to the number of absolute
                addresses any given project is allowed to consume from the pool. For
                example, with a quota of 128, I might get 203.0.113.128/26,
                203.0.113.224/28, and still have room to allocate 48 more addresses in
                the future.</para>
    <para>With IPv6 it is a little different. It is not practical to count
                individual addresses. To avoid ridiculously large numbers, the quota is
                expressed in the number of /64 subnets which can be allocated. For
                example, with a default_quota of 3, I might get 2001:db8:c18e:c05a::/64,
                2001:db8:221c:8ef3::/64, and still have room to allocate one more prefix
                in the future.</para>

    <title>Default subnet pools</title>
    <para>Beginning with Mitaka, a subnet pool can be marked as the default. This
                is handled with a new extension.</para>
    <screen language="console"><?dbsuse-fo font-size="8pt"?>$ openstack extension list | grep default-subnetpools

    <para>An administrator can mark a pool as default. Only one pool from each
                address family can be marked default.</para>
    <screen language="console">$ openstack subnet pool set --default 74348864-f8bf-4fc0-ab03-81229d189467</screen>

                    equally as well with IPv6 addresses.</para>
