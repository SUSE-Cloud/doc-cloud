    On the control plane nodes, you will want good I/O performance. Your array
    controllers must have cache controllers and we advise against the use of
    RAID-5.

    On compute nodes, the I/O performance will influence the virtual machine
    start-up performance. We also recommend the use of cache controllers in
    your storage arrays.

    If you are using dedicated object storage (swift) nodes, in particular the
    account, container, and object servers, we recommend that your storage
    arrays have cache controllers.

    For best performance on, set the servers power management
    setting in the iLO to OS Control Mode. This power mode setting is only
    available on servers that include the HP Power Regulator.
