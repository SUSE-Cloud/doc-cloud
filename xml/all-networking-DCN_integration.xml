 <title>DCN Integration with Multisite Support for Neutron</title>
 <!-- FIXME: This entire section seems to need larger edits:
  * uses DEB packages
  * uses random pip packages
  * explains stuff about "Tightly Controlled" HPE code that you might not
    have access to.

 <para>
  HPE Distributed Cloud Networking (DCN) is network overlay software that
  enables network virtualization both within data centers and between them.
  &kw-hos; allows you to use DCN as your networking. This choice is an
  all-or-nothing option in that you cannot use traditional networking in
  &kw-hos; if you choose to use DCN.
 </para>
 <para>
  For that reason, and others, you cannot upgrade an existing installation
  of &kw-hos; to &kw-hos; with DCN. The network configuration you had
  previously will not work. Therefore, to use DCN, you must install &kw-hos;
  as a new deployment, and follow the steps outlined in these documents.
 </para>
 <section>
  <title>Features not available when DCN is deployed</title>
  <para>
   Because of the foundational differences between DCN networks and traditional
   networking, when DCN is running in &kw-hos;, these features are not
   deployed:

    <para>
     Neutron-server must be running with either the Nuage mechanism driver
     (DCN-ML2) or the core-plugin (DCN-CORE-PLG). DCN-ML2 is preferred.

     VRS with the Nuage metadata-agent and VRS-G. VRS runs on compute nodes,
     VRS-G runs on a standalone node.

    <para>
     (Optional): Virtualized services controller (VSC) There are two ways to
     have VSC(s) deployed, one via playbooks and another via bringing up the
     provided VSC VM disk image.

    <para>
     The <xref linkend="DCN_ml2"/> you must download will need to be "staged"
     for deployment into &kw-hos; using the <xref linkend="DCN_ml2"/> The
     third-party import playbook does the staging.
    </para>

     After running the third-party import playbook, &kw-hos; needs to be

     (Optional) If VSC is to be deployed via playbooks, you will need to
     perform additional configuration steps and run the configuration processor
     again.
