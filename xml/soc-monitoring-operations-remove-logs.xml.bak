 <title>Removing Log Data</title>
 <para>
  Log data is stored in the Elasticsearch database. Elasticsearch stores the
  data in indices. One index per day is created for every OpenStack project.
 </para>
 <para>
  By default, the indices are stored in the following directory on the host
  where the Monitoring Service is installed:
 </para>
 <para>
  <literal>/var/data/elasticsearch/&lt;cluster-name&gt;/nodes/&lt;node-name&gt;</literal>
 </para>
 <para>
  Example:
 </para>
 <para>
  <literal>/var/data/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/nodes/0</literal>
 </para>
 <note>
  <para>
   If your system uses a different directory, look up the
   <literal>path.data</literal> parameter in the Elasticsearch configuration
   file, <literal>/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml</literal>.
  </para>
 </note>
 <para>
  If you want to delete outdated or unnecessary log data from the Elasticsearch
  database, proceed as follows:
 </para>
 <orderedlist>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Make sure that <literal>curl</literal> is installed. If this is not the
    case, install the package with
   </para>
   <screen>sudo zypper in curl</screen>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Create a backup of the Elasticsearch database.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Determine the ID of the OpenStack project for the data to be deleted:
   </para>
   <para>
    Log in to the OpenStack dashboard and go to <emphasis role="bold">Identity
    &gt; Projects</emphasis>.  The <literal>monasca</literal> project initially
    provides a ll metrics data related to <phrase>SUSE OpenStack Cloud
    Monitoring</phrase>.
   </para>
   <para>
    In the course of the productive operation of <phrase>SUSE OpenStack Cloud
    Monitoring</phrase>, additional projects may be created.
   </para>
   <para>
    The <emphasis role="bold">Project ID</emphasis> field shows the relevant
    ID.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Log in to the host where the Monitoring Service is installed.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Make sure that the data you want to delete exists by executing the
    following command:
   </para>
<screen>curl -XHEAD -i 'http://localhost:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;projectID-date&gt;'</screen>
   <para>
    For example, if Elasticsearch is listening at port 9200 (default), the ID
    of the OpenStack project is <literal>abc123</literal>, and you want to
    check the index of 2015, July 1st, the command is as follows:
   </para>
<screen>curl -XHEAD -i 'http://localhost:9200/abc123-2015-07-01'</screen>
   <para>
    If the HTTP response is <literal>200</literal>, the index exists; if the
    response is <literal>404</literal>, it does not exist.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Delete the index as follows:
   </para>
<screen>curl -XDELETE -i 'http://localhost:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;projectID-date&gt;'</screen>
   <para>
    Example:
   </para>
<screen>curl -XDELETE -i 'http://localhost:9200/abc123-2015-07-01'</screen>
   <para>
    This command either returns an error, such as
    <literal>IndexMissingException</literal>, or acknowledges the successful
    deletion of the index.
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </orderedlist>
 <note>
  <para>
   Be aware that the <literal>-XDELETE</literal> command immediately deletes
   the index file!
  </para>
 </note>
 <para>
  Both, for <literal>-XHEAD</literal> and <literal>-XDELETE</literal>, you can
  use wildcards for processing several indices. For example, you can delete all
  indices of a specific project for the whole month of July, 2015:
 </para>
<screen>curl -XDELETE -i 'http://localhost:9200/abc123-2015-07-*'</screen>
 <note>
  <para>
   Take extreme care when using wildcards for the deletion of indices. You
   could delete all existing indices with one single command!
  </para>
