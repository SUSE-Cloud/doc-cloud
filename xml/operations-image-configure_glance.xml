 <title>Configuring the Image Service</title>
 <para>
  The image service, based on &ostack; &o_img;, works out of the box and does
  not need any special configuration. However, we show you how to enable
  &o_img; image caching as well as how to configure your environment to allow
  the &o_img; copy-from feature if you choose to do so. A few features
  detailed below will require some additional configuration if you choose to
  use them.
 </para>
 <warning xml:id="image-warning">
  <para>
   &o_img; images are assigned IDs upon creation, either automatically or
   specified by the user. The ID of an image should be unique, so if a user
   assigns an ID which already exists, a conflict (409) will occur.
  </para>
  <para>
   This only becomes a problem if users can publicize or share images with
   others. If users can share images AND cannot publicize images then your
   system is not vulnerable. If the system has also been purged (via
   <literal>glance-manage db purge</literal>) then it is possible for deleted
   image IDs to be reused.
  </para>
  <para>
   If deleted image IDs can be reused then recycling of public and shared
   images becomes a possibility. This means that a new (or modified) image can
   replace an old image, which could be malicious.
  </para>

  <title>How to enable &o_img; image caching</title>
  <para>
   In &product;, by default, the &o_img; image caching option is not
   enabled. You have the option to have image caching enabled and these steps
   will show you how to do that.
  </para>
  <para>
   The main benefits to using image caching is that it will allow the &o_img;
   service to return the images faster and it will cause less load on other
   services to supply the image.
  </para>
  <para>
   In order to use the image caching option you will need to supply a logical
   volume for the service to use for the caching.
  </para>
  <para>
   If you wish to use the &o_img; image caching option, you will see the
   section below in your
   <literal>~/openstack/my_cloud/definition/data/disks_controller.yml</literal>
   file. You will specify the mount point for the logical volume you wish to
   use for this.

   <step>
    <para>
     Edit your
     <literal>~/openstack/my_cloud/definition/data/disks_controller.yml</literal>
     file and specify the volume and mount point for your <literal>glance-cache</literal>. Here is
     an example:
    </para>
<screen># &o_img; cache: if a logical volume with consumer usage glance-cache
# is defined &o_img; caching will be enabled. The logical volume can be
# part of an existing volume group or a dedicated volume group.
 - name: glance-vg
   physical-volumes:
     - /dev/sdx
   logical-volumes:
     - name: glance-cache
       size: 95%
       mount: /var/lib/glance/cache
       fstype: ext4
       mkfs-opts: -O large_file
       consumer:
         name: glance-api
         usage: glance-cache</screen>
    <para>
     If you are enabling image caching during your initial installation, prior
     to running <literal>site.yml</literal> the first time, then continue with
     the installation steps. However, if you are making this change
     post-installation then you will need to commit your changes with the steps
     below.

  <para>
   An existing volume image cache is not properly deleted when &o_blockstore;
   detects the source image has changed. After updating any source image,
   delete the cache volume so that the cache is refreshed.
  </para>
  <para>
   The volume image cache must be deleted before trying to use the associated
   source image in any other volume operations. This includes creating bootable
   volumes or booting an instance with <literal>create volume</literal> enabled
   and the updated image as the source image.

  <title>Allowing the &o_img; copy-from option in your environment</title>

   When creating images, one of the options you have is to copy the image from
   a remote location to your local &o_img; store. You do this by specifying the

   feature though you need to ensure the following conditions are met:
