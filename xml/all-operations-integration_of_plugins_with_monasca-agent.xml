        <para>Monasca-agent is an OpenStack open-source project. Monasca can also monitor non-openstack
            services. Third parties should install custom plugins into their &kw-hos-phrase; system using the steps outlined in the <emphasis role="bold">Writing Custom
                Plugins</emphasis> section. If the OpenStack community determines that the custom plugins
            are of general benefit, the plugin may be added to the openstack/monasca-agent so that
            they are installed with the monasca-agent. During the review process for
            openstack/monasca-agent there are no guarantees that code will be approved or merged by
            a deadline. Open-source contributors are expected to help with code reviews in order to
            get their code accepted. Once changes are approved and integrated into the
            openstack/monasca-agent and that version of the monasca-agent is integrated with
                &kw-hos-phrase;, the third party can remove the custom plugin
            installation steps since they would be installed  in the default monasca-agent venv.</para>
