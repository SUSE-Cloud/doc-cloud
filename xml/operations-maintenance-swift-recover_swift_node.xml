 <title>Recovering a Swift Node</title>
 <para>
  If one or more of your Swift Object or PAC nodes has experienced an issue,
  such as power loss or hardware failure, and you need to perform disaster
  recovery then we provide different scenarios and how to resolve them to get
  your cloud repaired.

 <para>
  Typical scenarios in which you will need to repair a Swift object or PAC
  node include:

  <title>What to do if your Swift host has shut down or rebooted</title>
  <para>
   If your Swift host has power but is not powered on, from the lifecycle
   manager you can run this playbook:
  </para>
  <orderedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Log in to the &clm;.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Obtain the name for your Swift host in Cobbler:
    </para>
<screen>sudo cobbler system list</screen>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Power the node back up with this playbook, specifying the node name from
     Cobbler:
    </para>
<screen>cd ~/openstack/ardana/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost bm-power-up.yml -e nodelist=&lt;node name&gt;</screen>
   </listitem>
  </orderedlist>
  <para>
   Once the node is booted up, Swift should start automatically. You can verify
   this with this playbook:
  </para>
<screen>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/ardana/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts swift-status.yml</screen>
  <para>
   Any alarms that have triggered due to the host going down should clear
   within 10 minutes. See <xref linkend="alarmdefinitions"/> if further
   assistance is needed with the alarms.
