  <title>Troubleshoot Object Storage</title>
  <para>For Object Storage, everything is logged in <literal>/var/log/syslog</literal> (or
            <literal>messages</literal> on some distros). Several settings enable further
            customization of logging, such as <literal>log_name</literal>, <literal>log_facility</literal>, and
            <literal>log_level</literal>, within the object server configuration files.</para>

      <title>Solution</title>
      <para>In the event that a drive has failed, the first step is to make sure the
                    drive is unmounted. This will make it easier for Object Storage to work
                    around the failure until it has been resolved. If the drive is going to
                    be replaced immediately, then it is just best to replace the drive,
                    format it, remount it, and let replication fill it up.</para>
      <para>If you cannot replace the drive immediately, then it is best to leave it
                    unmounted, and remove the drive from the ring. This will allow all the
                    replicas that were on that drive to be replicated elsewhere until the
                    drive is replaced. Once the drive is replaced, it can be re-added to the
                    ring.</para>
      <para>You can look at error messages in the <literal>/var/log/kern.log</literal> file for
                    hints of drive failure.</para>

    <title>Server failure</title>
    <section>
      <title>Problem</title>
      <para>The server is potentially offline, and may have failed, or require a
                    reboot.</para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="id2">
      <title>Solution</title>
      <para>If a server is having hardware issues, it is a good idea to make sure
                    the Object Storage services are not running. This will allow Object
                    Storage to work around the failure while you troubleshoot.</para>
      <para>If the server just needs a reboot, or a small amount of work that should
                    only last a couple of hours, then it is probably best to let Object
                    Storage work around the failure and get the machine fixed and back
                    online. When the machine comes back online, replication will make sure
                    that anything that is missing during the downtime will get updated.</para>
      <para>If the server has more serious issues, then it is probably best to
                    remove all of the server’s devices from the ring. Once the server has
                    been repaired and is back online, the server’s devices can be added back
                    into the ring. It is important that the devices are reformatted before
                    putting them back into the ring as it is likely to be responsible for a
                    different set of partitions than before.</para>

    <title>Detect failed drives</title>
    <section>
      <title>Problem</title>
      <para>When drives fail, it can be difficult to detect that a drive has failed,
                    and the details of the failure.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Solution</title>
      <para>It has been our experience that when a drive is about to fail, error
                    messages appear in the <literal>/var/log/kern.log</literal> file. There is a script called
                    <literal>swift-drive-audit</literal> that can be run via cron to watch for bad drives. If
                    errors are detected, it will unmount the bad drive, so that Object
                    Storage can work around it. The script takes a configuration file with
                    the following settings:</para>

      <title>Problem</title>
      <para>An emergency might prevent a successful backup from restoring the

      <title>Solution</title>
      <para>You should always keep a backup of swift ring builder files. However, if
                    an emergency occurs, this procedure may assist in returning your cluster
                    to an operational state.</para>
      <para>Using existing swift tools, there is no way to recover a builder file
                    from a <literal>ring.gz</literal> file. However, if you have a knowledge of Python, it
                    is possible to construct a builder file that is pretty close to the one
                    you have lost.</para>
      <warning>
        <para>This procedure is a last-resort for emergency circumstances. It
                        requires knowledge of the swift python code and may not succeed.</para>
      </warning>
      <procedure>
        <step>
          <para>Load the ring and a new ringbuilder object in a Python REPL:</para>
          <screen language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; from swift.common.ring import RingData, RingBuilder
&gt;&gt;&gt; ring = RingData.load('/path/to/account.ring.gz')</screen>
        </step>
        <step>
          <para>Start copying the data we have in the ring into the builder:</para>
          <screen language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; import math
&gt;&gt;&gt; partitions = len(ring._replica2part2dev_id[0])
&gt;&gt;&gt; replicas = len(ring._replica2part2dev_id)

&gt;&gt;&gt; builder = RingBuilder(int(math.log(partitions, 2)), replicas, 1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; builder.devs = ring.devs
&gt;&gt;&gt; builder._replica2part2dev = ring._replica2part2dev_id
&gt;&gt;&gt; builder._last_part_moves_epoch = 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; from array import array
&gt;&gt;&gt; builder._last_part_moves = array('B', (0 for _ in xrange(partitions)))
&gt;&gt;&gt; builder._set_parts_wanted()
&gt;&gt;&gt; for d in builder._iter_devs():
            d['parts'] = 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; for p2d in builder._replica2part2dev:
            for dev_id in p2d:
                builder.devs[dev_id]['parts'] += 1

This is the extent of the recoverable fields.</screen>
        </step>
        <step>
          <para>For <literal>min_part_hours</literal> you either have to remember what the value you
                            used was, or just make up a new one:</para>
          <screen language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; builder.change_min_part_hours(24) # or whatever you want it to be</screen>
        </step>
        <step>
          <para>Validate the builder. If this raises an exception, check your
                            previous code:</para>
          <screen language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; builder.validate()</screen>
        </step>
        <step>
          <para>After it validates, save the builder and create a new <literal>account.builder</literal>:</para>
          <screen language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; import pickle
&gt;&gt;&gt; pickle.dump(builder.to_dict(), open('account.builder', 'wb'), protocol=2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; exit ()</screen>
        </step>
        <step>
          <para>You should now have a file called <literal>account.builder</literal> in the current

                            <command>swift-ring-builder account.builder write_ring</command> and compare the new
                            <literal>account.ring.gz</literal> to the <literal>account.ring.gz</literal> that you started
                            from. They probably are not byte-for-byte identical, but if you load them
                            in a REPL and their <literal>_replica2part2dev_id</literal> and <literal>devs</literal> attributes are
                            the same (or nearly so), then you are in good shape.</para>
        </step>
        <step>
          <para>Repeat the procedure for <literal>container.ring.gz</literal> and
                            <literal>object.ring.gz</literal>, and you might get usable builder files.</para>
