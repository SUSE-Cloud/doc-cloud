 <title>Metric Performance Considerations</title>
 <para>
  Collecting metrics on your virtual machines can greatly affect performance.
  &kw-hos-phrase; supports 200 compute nodes, with up to 40 VMs each. If your
  environment is managing maximum number of VMs, adding a single metric for all
  VMs is the equivalent of adding 8000 metrics. If too many metrics are added,
  you may exceed the Vertica database license.
 </para>
 <para>
  Because of the potential impact that new metrics have on system performance,
  consider adding only new metrics that are useful for alarm-definition,
  capacity planning, or debugging process failure.
