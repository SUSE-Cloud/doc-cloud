 <title>&kw-hos-tm;: Preventing Host Header Poisoning</title>
 <para>
  Depending on the environment and context of your &kw-hos; deployment, it may
  be advisable to configure Horizon to protect against Host header poisoning
  (see ref. #1 below) by using Django's ALLOWED_HOSTS setting (see ref. #2
  below). To configure Horizon to use the ALLOWED_HOSTS setting, take the
  following steps:
 </para>
 <orderedlist>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Edit the haproxy settings to reconfigure the health check for Horizon to
    specify the allowed hostname(s). This needs to be done first, before
    configuring Horizon itself. Otherwise, if Horizon is first configured to
    restrict the values of the "Host" header on incoming HTTP requests, the
    haproxy health checks will start to fail. So, the haproxy configuration
    needs to be updated first, if this is being done on an existing
    installation.

    <listitem>
     <para>
      On your &clm; node, make a backup copy of this file and then open
      <emphasis role="bold">/usr/share/ardana/input-model/2.0/services/horizon.yml</emphasis>
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Find the line that contains "option httpchk" and modify it so it reads
      the following way:
     </para>
<screen>- "option httpchk GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHOST:\ my.example.com"
# Note the escaped escape characters.</screen>
     <para>
      In this example, my.example.com is the hostname associated with the
      Horizon VIP on the external API network. However, you are not restricted
      to just one allowed host. In addition, allowed hosts can contain
      wildcards (though not in the horizon.yml file; there you must have an
      actual resolvable hostname or a routeable IP address). However, for this
      change to the haproxy healthcheck, it is suggested that the hostname
      associated with the Horizon VIP on the external API network be used.

      Change the line that sets the "ALLOWED_HOSTS" setting. This can be a list
      of hostnames and (V)IPs that eventually get routed to Horizon. Wildcards
      are supported.
     </para>
<screen>ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['my.example.com', '*.example.net', '192.168.245.6']</screen>
     <para>
      In the above example, any HTTP request received with a hostname not
      matching any in this list will receive an HTTP 400 reply.

    Enable the configuration: This can be done in one of a few ways: As part of
    a site deploy play as part of an upgrade play or by re-running the FND-CLU
    and Horizon deploys on an existing deployment: If modifying an existing
    deploy, the FND-CLU deploy will need to be run first, since changing the
    ALLOWED_HOSTS setting in Horizon first will cause the default health check
    to fail, if it does not specify a <literal>Host</literal> header in the
    HTTP request sent to
    check the health of Horizon's Apache virtual host.
