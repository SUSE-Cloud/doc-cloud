 <para>To get technical support and product updates, you need to register and activate your SUSE
  product with the SUSE Customer Center. It is recommended to register during the installation,
  since this will enable you to install the system with the latest updates and patches available.
  However, if you are offline or want to skip the registration step, you can register at any time
  later from the installed system. </para>
 <note>
  <para> In case your organization does not provide a local registration server, registering SUSE
   Linux requires a SUSE account. In case you do not have a SUSE account yet, go to the SUSE
   Customer Center home page (<link xlink:href="https://scc.suse.com/">https://scc.suse.com/</link>)
   to create one.</para>
