 <title>Registering &slsa;</title>
 <para>
  To get technical support and product updates, you need to register and
  activate your &suse; product with the &scc;. It is recommended to register
  during the installation, since this will enable you to install the system
  with the latest updates and patches available. However, if you are offline or
  want to skip the registration step, you can register at any time later from
  the installed system.

  <para>
   In case your organization does not provide a local registration server,
   registering &slsa; requires a &suse; account. In case you do not have a
   &suse; account yet, go to the &scc; home page
   (<link xlink:href="https://scc.suse.com/">https://scc.suse.com/</link>) to
   create one.
