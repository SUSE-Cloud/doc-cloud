 <title>Server Groups and Networks</title>
 <para>
  Each L3 <guimenu>network</guimenu> in a cloud must be associated with all or
  some of the <guimenu>servers</guimenu>, typically following a physical
  pattern (such as having separate networks for each rack or set of racks).
  This is also represented in the &productname; model via
  <guimenu>server-groups</guimenu>, each group lists zero or more networks to
  which <guimenu>servers</guimenu> associated with
  <guimenu>server-groups</guimenu> at or below this point in the hierarchy are
  connected.
 </para>
 <para>
  When the configuration processor needs to resolve the specific
  <guimenu>network</guimenu> a <guimenu>server</guimenu> should be configured
  to use, it traverses up the hierarchy of <guimenu>server-groups</guimenu>,
  starting with the group the server is directly associated with, until it
  finds a server-group that lists a network in the required network group.
 </para>
 <para>
  The level in the <guimenu>server-group</guimenu> hierarchy at which a
  <guimenu>network</guimenu> is associated will depend on the span of
  connectivity it must provide. In the above example there might be networks in
  some <guimenu>network-groups</guimenu> which are per rack (that is Rack 1 and
  Rack 2 list different networks from the same
  <guimenu>network-group</guimenu>) and <guimenu>networks</guimenu> in a
  different <guimenu>network-group</guimenu> that span failure zones (the
  network used to provide floating IP addresses to virtual machines for
  example).
