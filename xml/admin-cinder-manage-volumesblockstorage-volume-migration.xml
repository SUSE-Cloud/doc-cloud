  <title>Migrate volumes</title>
  <para>OpenStack has the ability to migrate volumes between back-ends which support
            its volume-type. Migrating a volume transparently moves its data from the
            current back-end for the volume to a new one. This is an administrator
            function, and can be used for functions including storage evacuation (for
            maintenance or decommissioning), or manual optimizations (for example,
            performance, reliability, or cost).</para>
  <para>These workflows are possible for a migration:</para>
  <procedure>
    <step>
      <para>If the storage can migrate the volume on its own, it is given the
                    opportunity to do so. This allows the Block Storage driver to enable
                    optimizations that the storage might be able to perform. If the back-end
                    is not able to perform the migration, the Block Storage uses one of two
                    generic flows, as follows.</para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>If the volume is not attached, the Block Storage service creates a volume
                    and copies the data from the original to the new volume.</para>
      <note>
        <para>While most back-ends support this function, not all do. See the <link xlink:href="https://docs.openstack.org/ocata/config-reference/block-storage/volume-drivers.html">driver
                            documentation</link>
                        in the OpenStack Configuration Reference for more details.</para>
      </note>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>If the volume is attached to a VM instance, the Block Storage creates a
                    volume, and calls Compute to copy the data from the original to the new
                    volume. Currently this is supported only by the Compute libvirt driver.</para>
    </step>
  </procedure>
  <para>As an example, this scenario shows two LVM back-ends and migrates an attached
            volume from one to the other. This scenario uses the third migration flow.</para>
  <para>First, list the available back-ends:</para>
  <screen language="console"># cinder get-pools

| Property |                       Value                        |

  <note>
    <para>Only Block Storage V2 API supports <command>cinder get-pools</command>.</para>
  </note>
  <para>You can also get available back-ends like following:</para>
  <screen language="console"># cinder-manage host list
server1@lvmstorage-1    zone1
server2@lvmstorage-2    zone1</screen>
  <para>But it needs to add pool name in the end. For example,
            <literal>server1@lvmstorage-1#zone1</literal>.</para>
  <para>Next, as the admin user, you can see the current status of the volume
            (replace the example ID with your own):</para>

  <para>Note these attributes:</para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para><literal>os-vol-host-attr:host</literal> - the volume’s current back-end.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para><literal>os-vol-mig-status-attr:migstat</literal> - the status of this volume’s migration
                    (None means that a migration is not currently in progress).</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para><literal>os-vol-mig-status-attr:name_id</literal> - the volume ID that this volume’s name
                    on the back-end is based on. Before a volume is ever migrated, its name on
                    the back-end storage may be based on the volume’s ID (see the
                    <literal>volume_name_template</literal> configuration parameter). For example, if
                    <literal>volume_name_template</literal> is kept as the default value (<literal>volume-%s</literal>), your
                    first LVM back-end has a logical volume named
                    <literal>volume-6088f80a-f116-4331-ad48-9afb0dfb196c</literal>. During the course of a
                    migration, if you create a volume and copy over the data, the volume get
                    the new name but keeps its original ID. This is exposed by the <literal>name_id</literal>
                    attribute.</para>
      <note>
        <para>If you plan to decommission a block storage node, you must stop the
                        <literal>cinder</literal> volume service on the node after performing the migration.</para>
        <para>On SUSE Linux Enterprise, run:</para>
        <screen language="console"># service openstack-cinder-volume stop
# chkconfig openstack-cinder-volume off</screen>
        <para>Stopping the cinder volume service will prevent volumes from being
                        allocated to the node.</para>

  <para>Migrate this volume to the second LVM back-end:</para>

Request to migrate volume 6088f80a-f116-4331-ad48-9afb0dfb196c has been
accepted.</screen>
  <para>You can use the <command>openstack volume show</command> command to see the status of
            the migration. While migrating, the <literal>migstat</literal> attribute shows states such as
            <literal>migrating</literal> or <literal>completing</literal>. On error, <literal>migstat</literal> is set to None and the
            host attribute shows the original <literal>host</literal>. On success, in this example, the
            output looks like:</para>

  <para>Note that <literal>migstat</literal> is None, host is the new host, and <literal>name_id</literal> holds the
            ID of the volume created by the migration. If you look at the second LVM back
            end, you find the logical volume

  <note>
    <para>The migration is not visible to non-admin users (for example, through the
                volume <literal>status</literal>). However, some operations are not allowed while a
                migration is taking place, such as attaching/detaching a volume and
                deleting a volume. If a user performs such an action during a migration,
                an error is returned.</para>

    <para>Migrating volumes that have snapshots are currently not allowed.</para>
