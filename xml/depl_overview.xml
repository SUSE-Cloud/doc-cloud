  <title>The &admserv;</title>

  <para>
   The &admserv; provides all services needed to manage and deploy all other
   nodes in the cloud. Most of these services are provided by the &crow;
   tool that automates in conjunction with &chef; all the required
   installation and configuration tasks. Among the services provided by the
   server are DHCP, DNS, NTP, PXE, TFTP.

   The &admserv; also hosts the software repositories for &sls; and

  </itemizedlist>

  <para>
   Being a central point in the &cloud; architecture that runs a lot of
   services, a single &contrnode; can quickly become a performance
   bottleneck, especially in large &cloud; deployments. It is possible to
   distribute the services listed above on more than one &contrnode;, up to
   a setup where each service runs on its own node.
  </para>

  <para>
   Deploying &netw; (&o_netw;) on a distinct node is a general
   recommendation for production clouds. It will separate the network
   management and most of the network traffic and will also allow to define
   a distinct network mode for this node (see
   <xref linkend="app.deploy.network_json"/> for details).
  </para>

  <para>
   Hosting &ident; (&o_ident;) on a distinct node enables you to separate
   authentication and authorization services from other cloud services for
   security reasons. Another <quote>good candidate</quote> to be hosted on a
   separate node is &blockstore; (&o_blockstore;, particularly the
   cinder-volume role) when using local disks for storage. Deploying it on
   one or more separate node enables you to equip the node with storage and
   network hardware best suiting the service.
  </para>

  <note>
   <title>Moving Services in an Existing Setup</title>
   <para>
    In case you plan to move a service in an already deployed &cloud; from
    one &contrnode; to another, it is strongly recommended to shut down or
    save <emphasis>all</emphasis> &vmguest;s before doing so (and restart
    them after having successfully re-deployed the services). Moving services
    also requires to stop them manually on the original &contrnode;.
<!-- See FIXME for more
    information on &cloud; maintenance. -->
    <!-- TODO vuntz 2013-12-04: actually, right now, this probably doesn't work well without manual intervention (to at least stop the services on the old node -->
   </para>
  </note>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 id="sec.depl.arch.components.compute">
  <title>The &compnode;s</title>

  <para>
   The &compnode;s are the pool of machines on which the &vmguest;s are
   running. These machines need to be equipped with a sufficient number of
   CPUs and enough RAM to start several &vmguest;s. They also need to
   provide sufficient hard disk space, see
   <xref
   linkend="sec.depl.req.storage.hardware.compute"/> for details.
   The &contrnode; effectively distributes &vmguest;s within the pool of
   &compnode;s and provides the necessary network resources. The &ostack;
   service &comp; (Nova) runs on the &compnode;s and provides means for
   setting up, starting, and stopping virtual machines.
  </para>

  <para>
   &productname; supports several hypervisors such as Hyper-V, &kvm;, QEMU,
   VMware vSphere or &xen;.  Each image that can be started with an &vmguest;
   is bound to one hypervisor. Each &compnode; can only run one hypervisor at
   a time. You can choose which hypervisor to run on which &compnode; when
   deploying the Nova &barcl;.
  </para>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 id="sec.depl.arch.components.storage">
  <title>The &stornode;s</title>

  <para>
   The &stornode;s are the pool of machines providing object storage. &cloud;
   offers two different types of storage: object and block storage. Object
   storage is provided by the &ostack; &swift; component, while block
   storage is provided by &ceph;. Deploying &swift; is optional, &ceph; is
   available as a technology preview.
  </para>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 id="sec.depl.arch.components.ha">
  <title>&ha; Setup</title>
   <para>A failure of some crucial components in &productname; can lead to
   system downtime and/or data loss. To prevent this, a maintenance update for
   &productname; &productnumber; allows you to make all functions
   provided by the &contrnode;(s) highly available. During cloud deployment,
   you can choose to apply certain roles to an &ha; (HA) cluster (consisting of
   several cluster nodes) instead of applying them to individual cloud
   nodes.</para>
  <para>
   <remark>taroth 2014-03-26: DEVs - are all the roles mentioned at
    http://etherpad.cloud.suse.de/p/cloud-HA-user-docs, "HA for the OpenStack
    infrastructure" usually running on the Controller Node? not sure I already
    want to mention the individual services at this point...</remark> 
   This includes especially the roles for data, services, and network running on
   the &contrnode;(s). With an &hasetup;, the cloud will continue to
   operate in case of an outage of one or more &contrnode;s. This also includes the
   ability to start and stop VMs on the &compnode;, without loss of
   state.</para>
  <para>For all HA-enabled roles, the respective functions are
   automatically handled by the clustering software &sle; &hasi;. The
   &hasi; uses the Pacemaker cluster stack with Pacemaker as cluster
   resource manager and &corosync;/&ais; as messaging/infrastructure
   layer.</para>
  <!--taroth 2014-03-26: maybe move these details to the requirements chapter?-->
  <para>You can view the cluster status and configuration
   <!--any details like configuration of
   cluster resources or global cluster options-->
   with the cluster management tools &haweb; (&hawk;), &hbgui;, or
   the <command>crm</command> shell. Note however, that these tools provide a
   read-only view, because all of the clustering configuration is done
   automatically via &crow; and &chef;&mdash;you do not need to
   configure anything manually. When doing any manual changes with the cluster
   management tools you run the risk of breaking the cluster or have the changes
   reverted by the next run of &chef; anyway.</para>
  <para>A failure of the &ostack; infra-structure services (running on the
   &contrnode;) is the most crucial point of failure that can cause
   downtimes within the cloud. For more information on how to make those
   services highly-available and on how to avoid other potential points of
   failure in your cloud setup, refer to <xref linkend="sec.depl.req.ha"
   />.</para>
