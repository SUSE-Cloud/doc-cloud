  <title>The &admserv;</title>

  <para>
   The &admserv; provides all services needed to manage and deploy all
   other nodes in the cloud. Most of these services are provided by the
   &crow; tool that&mdash;together with &chef;&mdash;automates all the
   required installation and configuration tasks. Among the services
   provided by the server are DHCP, DNS, NTP, PXE, and TFTP.

   The &admserv; also hosts the software repositories for &sls; and

   with updates and patches for all nodes.

  <para>
   &productname; requires a three-node cluster for any production deployment
   since it leverages a &mariadb_cluster; for high availability.
  </para>

  <para>
   We recommend deploying certain parts of &netw; (&o_netw;) on separate nodes for production clouds. See
   <xref linkend="sec-depl-ostack-neutron"/> for details.
  </para>

  <para>
   You can separate authentication and authorization services from other cloud
   services, for stronger security, by hosting &ident; (&o_ident;) on a
   separate node. Hosting &blockstore; (&o_blockstore;, particularly the
   cinder-volume role) on a separate node when using local disks for storage
   enables you to customize your storage and network hardware to best meet your
   requirements.
  </para>

  <note>
   <title>Moving Services in an Existing Setup</title>
   <para>
    If you plan to move a service from one &contrnode; to another, we strongly recommended shutting down or saving <emphasis>all</emphasis> &vmguest;s before doing so. Restart
    them after having successfully re-deployed the services. Moving
    services also requires stopping them manually on the original
    &contrnode;.
<!-- See TODO for more
    information on &cloud; maintenance. -->
<!-- TODO vuntz 2013-12-04: actually, right now, this probably doesn't work well without manual intervention (to at least stop the services on the old node -->
   </para>
  </note>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 xml:id="sec-depl-arch-components-compute">
  <title>The &compnode;s</title>

  <para>
   The &compnode;s are the pool of machines on which your &vmguest;s
   are running. These machines need to be equipped with a sufficient number
   of CPUs and enough RAM to start several &vmguest;s. They also need to
   provide sufficient hard disk space, see
   <xref linkend="sec-depl-req-storage-hardware-compute"/> for details. The
   &contrnode; distributes &vmguest;s within the pool of
   &compnode;s and provides them with the necessary network resources. The
   &ostack; component &comp; (nova) runs on the &compnode;s and
   provides the means for setting up, starting, and stopping virtual machines.
  </para>

  <para>
   &productname; supports several hypervisors, including &kvm; and  &vmware;
   vSphere. Each image that is started with an &vmguest; is
   bound to one hypervisor. Each &compnode; can only run one hypervisor
   at a time. You will choose which hypervisor to run on each &compnode;
   when deploying the nova &barcl;.
  </para>

 </sect1>
 <sect1 xml:id="sec-depl-arch-components-storage">
  <title>The &stornode;s</title>

  <para>
   The &stornode;s are the pool of machines providing object or block
   storage. Object storage is provided by the &ostack; &swift; component,
   while block storage is provided by &o_blockstore;. The latter supports several
   back-ends, including &ceph;, that are deployed during the
   installation. Deploying &swift; and &ceph; is optional.

  <title>The Monitoring Node</title>
  <para>
The Monitoring Node is the node that has the <literal>monasca-server</literal> role assigned.

Currently there can only be one Monitoring node. Clustering support is
planned for a future release. We strongly recommend using a dedicated physical
node without any other services as a &monitnode;.

 <sect1 xml:id="sec-depl-arch-components-ha">
  <title>&haSetup;</title>

  <para>
   A failure of components in &productname; can lead to system downtime
   and data loss. To prevent this, set up a &ha; (HA) cluster
   consisting of several nodes. You can assign certain roles to this cluster
   instead of assigning them to individual nodes. As of &productname;
   8, &contrnode;s and &compnode;s can be made highly available.
  </para>

  <para>
   For all HA-enabled roles, their respective functions are automatically
   handled by the clustering software &sle; &hasi;. The &hasi; uses
   the Pacemaker cluster stack with Pacemaker as cluster resource manager,
   and &corosync; as the messaging/infrastructure layer.
  </para>

   View the cluster status and configuration with the cluster
   management tools &haweb; (&hawk;) or the
   <command>crm</command> shell.

  <important>
   <title>Do Not Change the Configuration</title>
   <para>
    Use the cluster management tools only for <emphasis>viewing</emphasis>.
    All of the clustering configuration is done automatically via &crow;
    and &chef;. If you change anything via the cluster management tools
    you risk breaking the cluster. Changes done there may be reverted by the
    next run of &chef; anyway.
   </para>
  </important>

  <para>
   A failure of the &ostack; infrastructure services (running on the
   &contrnode;s) can be critical and may cause downtime within the cloud. For more information on making those services highly-available and avoiding other potential points of
   failure in your cloud setup, refer to <xref linkend="sec-depl-req-ha"/>.
