    <title>Load Balancers</title>


    <para><guilabel>Load-balancers</guilabel> provide a specific type of routing and are defined
        <!--in <uicontrol>network-groups</uicontrol> -->as a relationship between the virtual IP
        address (VIP) on a network in one <guilabel>network group</guilabel> and a set of service
        endpoints (which may be on <guilabel>networks</guilabel> in the same or a different
            <guilabel>network-group</guilabel>).</para>

    <para>As each <guilabel>load-balancer</guilabel> is defined providing a virtual IP on a
            <guilabel>network-group</guilabel>, it follows that those
            <guilabel>network-group</guilabel>s
        <!--containing a
        <uicontrol>load-balancer</uicontrol>--> can each only have one
            <guilabel>network</guilabel> associated to them.</para>


    <para>The <guilabel>load-balancer</guilabel> definition includes a list of
            <guilabel>service-components</guilabel> and endpoint roles it will provide a virtual IP
        for. This model allows service-specific <guilabel>load-balancers</guilabel> to be defined on
        different <guilabel>network-groups</guilabel>. A "default" value is used to express "all
        service-components" which require a virtual IP address and are not explicitly configured in
        another <guilabel>load-balancer</guilabel> configuration. The details of how the
            <guilabel>load-balancer</guilabel> should be configured for each service, such as which
        ports to use, how to check for service liveness, etc, are provided in the &kw-hos;
        supplied service definition files.</para>



    <para>Where there are multiple instances of a service (i.e in a cloud with multiple
        control-planes), each control-plane needs its own set of virtual IP address and different
        values for some properties such as the external name and security certificate. To
        accommodate this in &kw-hos-phrase;, load-balancers are defined as part of the
        control-plane, with the network groups defining just which load-balancers are attached to
        them.</para>


    <para>Load balancers are always implemented by an ha-proxy service in the same control-plane as
        the services. </para>
