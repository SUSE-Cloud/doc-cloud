  <title>Keeping the Nodes Up-To-Date</title>
  <para>
   Keeping the nodes in &productname; up-to-date requires an appropriate
   setup of the update and pool repositories and the deployment of
   either the <guimenu>Updater</guimenu> &barcl; or the &susemgr;
   &barcl;.
  </para>
  <para>
   If one of those &barcl;s is deployed, patches are installed on the
   nodes. Patches that do not require a reboot will not cause a service
   interruption. If a patch (for example, a kernel
   update) requires a reboot after the installation, services running on the
   machine that is rebooted will not be available within &cloud;.
   Therefore it is strongly recommended to install those patches during a
   maintenance window.

    As of &productname; 8, it is not possible to put

  <para>
   Upgrading from &productname; 7 to &productname; 8 can be done either via a

      Depending on the outcome of the checks, it is automatically decided
      whether the upgrade procedure will continue in non-disruptive or in
      normal mode.
     </para>
     <tip>
      <para>
       The non-disruptive update will take longer than an upgrade in normal
       mode, because it performs certain tasks in parallel which are done
       sequentially during the non-disruptive upgrade. Live-migrating guests to
       other &compnode;s during the non-disruptive
       upgrade takes additional time.
      </para>
      <para>
       Therefore, if a non-disruptive upgrade is not a requirement for you, you
       may want to switch to the normal upgrade mode, even if your setup
       supports the non-disruptive method. To force the normal upgrade mode,
       run:
      </para>
      <screen>&prompt.root;crowbarctl upgrade mode normal</screen>
      <para>
       To query the current upgrade mode run:
      </para>
      <screen>&prompt.root;crowbarctl upgrade mode</screen>

       To switch back to the non-disruptive mode run:
      </para>
      <screen>&prompt.root;crowbarctl upgrade mode non_disruptive</screen>
      <para>
       It is possible to call this command at any time during the upgrade
       process until the <literal>services</literal> step is started. After
       that point the upgrade mode can no longer be changed.

       To PXE boot new nodes, an additional &cloudos; repository&mdash;a copy

       during the upgrade procedure, it is recommended to set up this directory
       now. Refer to <link xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/documentation/suse-openstack-cloud-8/book_deployment/data/sec_depl_adm_conf_repos_product.html">Copying the Product Media Repositories</link>

      &admserv; and can be used to restore the database in case something goes
      wrong during the upgrade.
     </para>
     <screen>&prompt.root;crowbarctl upgrade backup openstack</screen>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      The final step of the upgrade procedure is upgrading the
      nodes.  To start the process, enter:
     </para>
     <screen>&prompt.root;crowbarctl upgrade nodes all</screen>
     <para>
      The upgrade process runs in the background and can be queried with
      <command>crowbarctl upgrade status</command>. Depending on the size of
      your &cloud; it may take several hours, especially when performing a
      non-disruptive update. In that case, the &compnode;s are updated
      one-by-one after &vmguest;s have been live-migrated to other nodes.
     </para>
     <para>
      Instead of upgrading all nodes you may also upgrade
      the &contrnode;s first and individual &compnode;s afterwards. Refer to
      <command>crowbarctl upgrade nodes --help</command> for details. If you
      choose this approach, you can use the <command>crowbarctl upgrade
      status</command> command to monitor the upgrade process. The output of
      this command contains the following entries:
     </para>
      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>
            current_node_action
          </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            The current action applied to the node.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>
            current_substep
          </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Shows the current substep of the node upgrade step. For example,
            for the <command>crowbarctl upgrade nodes controllers</command>,
            the <literal>current_substep</literal> entry displays the
            <literal>controller_nodes</literal> status when upgrading controllers.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
      </variablelist>
     <para>
       After the controllers have been upgraded, the
       <literal>steps.nodes.status</literal> entry in the output displays the
       <literal>running</literal> status. Check then the status of the
       <literal>current_substep_status</literal> entry. If it displays
       <literal>finished</literal>, you can move to the next step of upgrading
       the &compnode;s.
     </para>
     <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">Postponing the Upgrade</emphasis>
     </para>
     <para>
      It is possible to stop the upgrade of compute nodes and postpone their
      upgrade with the command:
     </para>
     <screen>&prompt.root;crowbarctl upgrade nodes postpone</screen>
     <para>
      After the upgrade of compute nodes is postponed, you can go to &crow;
      &wi;, check the configuration. You can also apply some changes, provided
      they do not affect the &compnode;s. During the postponed upgrade, all
      &ostack; services should be up and running. &compnode;s are still
      running old version of services.
     </para>
     <para>
      To resume the upgrade, issue the command:
     </para>
     <screen>&prompt.root;crowbarctl upgrade nodes resume</screen>
     <para>
      And finish the upgrade with either <command>crowbarctl upgrade nodes
      all</command> or upgrade nodes one node by one with <command>crowbarctl
      upgrade nodes <replaceable>NODE_NAME</replaceable></command>.
     </para>
     <para>
       When upgrading individual &compnode;s using the <command>crowbarctl
       upgrade nodes</command> <replaceable>NODE_NAME</replaceable> command, the
       <literal>current_substep_status</literal> entry changes to
       <literal>node_finished</literal> when the upgrade of a single node is
       done. After all nodes have been upgraded, the
       <literal>current_substep_status</literal> entry displays <literal>finished</literal>.
     </para>
    </step>
   </procedure>
   <note>
    <para>
     If an error occurs during the upgrade process, the output of the
     <command>crowbarctl upgrade status</command> provides a detailed
     description of the failure. In most cases, both the output and the error
     message offer enough information for fixing the issue. When the problem has
     been solved, run the previously-issued upgrade command to resume the
     upgrade process.

     The most likely reason is a problem with STONITH devices.

     Check whether the <systemitem>crowbar_join</systemitem> script ran
     successfully on the &compnode;. If this is not the case, check the log
     files to find out the reason. Refer to
     <link xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/documentation/suse-openstack-cloud-8/book_deployment/data/sec_deploy_logs_crownodes.html">On All Other Crowbar Nodes</link>

    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Check whether the remote node is registered and considered healthy by the
     core cluster. If this is not the case check
     <filename>/var/log/pacemaker.log</filename> on the &dc;
     to determine the cause. There should be a remote primitive running on the
     core cluster (active/passive). This primitive is responsible for
     establishing a TCP connection to the
     <systemitem>pacemaker_remote</systemitem> service on port 3121 of the
     &compnode;. Ensure that nothing is preventing this particular TCP
     connection from being established (for example, problems with NICs,
     switches, firewalls etc.). One way to do this is to run the following
     commands:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;lsof -i tcp:3121
&prompt.user;tcpdump tcp port 3121
</screen>

     If &pacemaker; can communicate with the remote node, it should start the
     <systemitem>nova-compute</systemitem> service on it as part of the cloned
     group <literal>cl-g-nova-compute</literal> using the NovaCompute OCF
     resource agent. This cloned group will block startup of

     started.

     A necessary, related but different procedure is described in

   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     It may happen that <systemitem>NovaCompute</systemitem> has been launched
     correctly on the &compnode; by <systemitem>lrmd</systemitem>, but the
     <systemitem>openstack-nova-compute</systemitem> service is still not
     running. This usually happens when <systemitem>nova-evacuate</systemitem>
     did not run correctly.
    </para>
    <para>
     If <systemitem>nova-evacuate</systemitem> is not
     running on one of the core cluster nodes, make sure that the service is
     marked as started (<literal>target-role="Started"</literal>). If this is
     the case, then your cloud does not have any &compnode;s already running as
     assumed by this procedure.
    </para>
    <para>
     If <systemitem>nova-evacuate</systemitem> is started but it is

    <para>
     If <systemitem>nova-evacuate</systemitem> is started and
     functioning correctly, it should call &o_comp;'s
     <literal>evacuate</literal> API to release resources used by the
     &compnode; and resurrect elsewhere any VMs that died when it failed.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     If <systemitem>openstack-nova-compute</systemitem> is running, but VMs are
     not booted on the node, check that the service is not disabled or
     forced down using the <command>nova service-list</command> command. In
     case the service is disabled, run the <command>nova service-enable
     <replaceable>SERVICE_ID</replaceable></command> command. If the service is
     forced down, run the following commands:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;fence_nova_param () {
    key="$1"
    cibadmin -Q -A "//primitive[@id='fence-nova']//nvpair[@name='$key']" | \

   The above steps should be performed automatically after the node is
   booted. If that does not happen, try the following debugging techniques.
  </para>
  <para>
   Check the <literal>evacuate</literal> attribute for the &compnode; in the
   &pacemaker; cluster's <systemitem>attrd</systemitem> service using the
   command:
  </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;attrd_updater -p -n evacuate -N <replaceable>NODE</replaceable></screen>
  <para>
   Possible results are the following:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>The attribute is not set. Refer to Step 1 in <xref linkend="recover-comp-node-failure"/>.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The attribute is set to <literal>yes</literal>. This means that the
     &compnode; was fenced, but <systemitem>nova-evacuate</systemitem> never
     initiated the recovery procedure by calling &o_comp;'s evacuate API.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The attribute contains a time stamp, in which case the recovery procedure
     was initiated at the time indicated by the time stamp, but has not
     completed yet.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     If the attribute is set to <literal>no</literal>, the recovery procedure
     recovered successfully and the cloud is ready for the &compnode; to
     rejoin.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>
   If the attribute is stuck with the wrong value, it can be set to
   <literal>no</literal> using the command:
  </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;attrd_updater -n evacuate -U no -N <replaceable>NODE</replaceable></screen>
  <para>
   After standard fencing has been performed, fence agent
   <systemitem>fence_compute</systemitem> should activate the secondary
   fencing device (<literal>fence-nova</literal>). It does this by setting
   the attribute to <literal>yes</literal> to mark the node as needing
   recovery. The agent also calls &o_comp;'s
   <systemitem>force_down</systemitem> API to notify it that the host is down.
   You should be able to see this in
   <filename>/var/log/nova/fence_compute.log</filename> on the node in the core
   cluster that was running the <systemitem>fence-nova</systemitem> agent at
   the time of fencing. During the recovery, <literal>fence_compute</literal>
   tells &o_comp; that the host is up and running again.
  </para>

 <section xml:id="bootstrap-compute-plane">
  <title>Bootstrapping Compute Plane</title>
  <para>
   If the whole compute plane is down, it is not always obvious how to boot it
   up, because it can be subject to deadlock if evacuate attributes are set on
   every &compnode;. In this case, manual intervention is
   required. Specifically, the operator must manually choose one or more
   &compnode;s to bootstrap the compute plane, and then run the
   <command>attrd_updater -n evacuate -U no -N <replaceable>NODE</replaceable></command>
   command for each
   of those &compnode;s to indicate that they do not require the resurrection
   process and can have their <literal>nova-compute</literal> start up straight
   away. Once these &compnode;s are up, this breaks the deadlock allowing
   <literal>nova-evacuate</literal> to start. This way, any other nodes that
   require resurrection can be processed automatically. If no resurrection is
   desired anywhere in the cloud, then the attributes should be set to
   <literal>no</literal> for all nodes.
  </para>
  <important>
   <para>
    Keep in mind that if &compnode;s are started too long after the
    <literal>remote-*</literal> resources are started on the control plane,
    they will be liable to fencing and so this should be avoided.
