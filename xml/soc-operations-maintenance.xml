  <title>Keeping the Nodes Up-To-Date</title>
  <para>
   Keeping the nodes in &productname; up-to-date requires an appropriate
   setup of the update and pool repositories and the deployment of
   either the <guimenu>Updater</guimenu> &barcl; or the &susemgr;
   &barcl;. For details, see
   <xref linkend="sec.depl.adm_conf.repos.scc"/>, <xref
   linkend="sec.depl.inst.nodes.post.updater"/>, and
   <xref linkend="sec.depl.inst.nodes.post.manager"/>.
  </para>
  <para>
   If one of those &barcl;s is deployed, patches are installed on the
   nodes. Patches that do not require a reboot will not cause a service
   interruption. If a patch (for example, a kernel
   update) requires a reboot after the installation, services running on the
   machine that is rebooted will not be available within &cloud;.
   Therefore it is strongly recommended to install those patches during a
   maintenance window.

  <title>Upgrading from &productname; 8 to &productname; 9</title>
  <para>
   Upgrading from &productname; 8 to &productname; 9 can be done either via a

      Depending on the outcome of the checks, it is automatically decided

      <title>Forcing Normal Mode Upgrade</title>
      <para>
       The non-disruptive update will take longer than an upgrade in normal
       mode, because it performs certain tasks in parallel which are done
       sequentially during the non-disruptive upgrade. Live-migrating guests to
       other &compnode;s during the non-disruptive
       upgrade takes additional time.
      </para>
      <para>
       Therefore, if a non-disruptive upgrade is not a requirement for you, you
       may want to switch to the normal upgrade mode, even if your setup
       supports the non-disruptive method. To force the normal upgrade mode,
       run:
      </para>
      <screen>&prompt.root;crowbarctl upgrade mode normal</screen>
      <para>
       To query the current upgrade mode run:
      </para>
      <screen>&prompt.root;crowbarctl upgrade mode</screen>
      <para>
       To switch back to the non-disruptive mode run:
      </para>
      <screen>&prompt.root;crowbarctl upgrade mode non_disruptive</screen>
      <para>
       It is possible to call this command at any time during the upgrade
       process until the <literal>services</literal> step is started. After
       that point the upgrade mode can no longer be changed.

      To ensure the status of the nodes does not change during the upgrade
      process, the majority of the &ostack; services will be stopped on the
      nodes. As a result, the &ostack; API will no longer be
      accessible. The &vmguest;s, however, will continue to run and will also
      be accessible. Run the following command:
     </para>
     <screen>&prompt.root;crowbarctl upgrade services</screen>
     <para>
      This step takes a while to finish. Monitor the process by running
      <command>crowbarctl upgrade status</command>. Do not proceed before
      <literal>steps.services.status</literal> is set to
      <literal>passed</literal>.
     </para>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      The last step before upgrading the nodes is to make a backup of the
      &ostack; &postgres; database. The database dump will be stored on the
      &admserv; and can be used to restore the database in case something goes
      wrong during the upgrade.

     <screen>&prompt.root;crowbarctl upgrade backup openstack</screen>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      The final step of the upgrade procedure is upgrading the
      nodes.  To start the process, enter:
     </para>
     <screen>&prompt.root;crowbarctl upgrade nodes all</screen>
     <para>
      The upgrade process runs in the background and can be queried with
      <command>crowbarctl upgrade status</command>. Depending on the size of
      your &cloud; it may take several hours, especially when performing a
      non-disruptive update. In that case, the &compnode;s are updated
      one-by-one after &vmguest;s have been live-migrated to other nodes.
     </para>
     <para>
      Instead of upgrading all nodes you may also upgrade
      the &contrnode;s first and individual &compnode;s afterwards. Refer to
      <command>crowbarctl upgrade nodes --help</command> for details. If you
      choose this approach, you can use the <command>crowbarctl upgrade
      status</command> command to monitor the upgrade process. The output of
      this command contains the following entries:
     </para>
      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>
            current_node_action

          </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Shows the current substep of the node upgrade step. For example,
            for the <command>crowbarctl upgrade nodes controllers</command>,
            the <literal>current_substep</literal> entry displays the
            <literal>controller_nodes</literal> status when upgrading controllers.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
      </variablelist>
     <para>
       After the controllers have been upgraded, the
       <literal>steps.nodes.status</literal> entry in the output displays the
       <literal>running</literal> status. Check then the status of the
       <literal>current_substep_status</literal> entry. If it displays
       <literal>finished</literal>, you can move to the next step of upgrading
       the &compnode;s.

      It is possible to stop the upgrade of compute nodes and postpone their

     </para>
     <screen>&prompt.root;crowbarctl upgrade nodes postpone</screen>
     <para>
      After the upgrade of compute nodes is postponed, you can go to &crow;
      &wi;, check the configuration. You can also apply some changes, provided
      they do not affect the &compnode;s. During the postponed upgrade, all
      &ostack; services should be up and running. &compnode;s are still
      running old version of services.
     </para>

      To resume the upgrade, issue the command:
     </para>
     <screen>&prompt.root;crowbarctl upgrade nodes resume</screen>
     <para>
      And finish the upgrade with either <command>crowbarctl upgrade nodes

      upgrade nodes <replaceable>NODE_NAME</replaceable></command>.
     </para>
     <para>
       When upgrading individual &compnode;s using the <command>crowbarctl

    <title>Dealing with Errors</title>
    <para>
     If an error occurs during the upgrade process, the output of the

   After standard fencing has been performed, fence agent

   <systemitem>force_down</systemitem> API to notify it that the host is down.
   You should be able to see this in
   <filename>/var/log/nova/fence_compute.log</filename> on the node in the core
   cluster that was running the <systemitem>fence-nova</systemitem> agent at
   the time of fencing. During the recovery, <literal>fence_compute</literal>
   tells &o_comp; that the host is up and running again.

  <title>Bootstrapping the Compute Plane</title>
  <para>
   If the whole compute plane is down, it is not always obvious how to boot it
   up, because it can be subject to deadlock if evacuate attributes are set on
   every &compnode;. In this case, manual intervention is
   required. Specifically, the operator must manually choose one or more
   &compnode;s to bootstrap the compute plane, and then run the
   <command>attrd_updater -n evacuate -U no -N <replaceable>NODE</replaceable></command>
   command for each
   of those &compnode;s to indicate that they do not require the resurrection
   process and can have their <literal>nova-compute</literal> start up straight
   away. Once these &compnode;s are up, this breaks the deadlock allowing
   <literal>nova-evacuate</literal> to start. This way, any other nodes that
   require resurrection can be processed automatically. If no resurrection is
   desired anywhere in the cloud, then the attributes should be set to
   <literal>no</literal> for all nodes.
