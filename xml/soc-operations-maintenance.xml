  <title>Keeping the Nodes Up-To-Date</title>
  <para>
   Keeping the nodes in &productname; up-to-date requires an appropriate
   setup of the update and pool repositories and the deployment of
   either the <guimenu>Updater</guimenu> &barcl; or the &susemgr;
   &barcl;. For details, see
   <xref linkend="sec.depl.adm_conf.repos.scc"/>, <xref
   linkend="sec.depl.inst.nodes.post.updater"/>, and
   <xref linkend="sec.depl.inst.nodes.post.manager"/>.
  </para>
  <para>
   If one of those &barcl;s is deployed, patches are installed on the
   nodes. Patches that do not require a reboot will not cause a service
   interruption. If a patch (for example, a kernel update) requires a reboot
   after the installation, services running on the machine that is rebooted
   will not be available within &cloud;.  Therefore, we strongly recommend
   installing those patches during a maintenance window.

  <title>Upgrading from &productname; 8 to &productname; 9</title>
  <para>
   Upgrading from &productname; 8 to &productname; 9 can be done either via a

      Depending on the outcome of the checks, it is automatically decided

     <tip>
      <title>Forcing Normal Mode Upgrade</title>
      <para>
       The non-disruptive update will take longer than an upgrade in normal
       mode, because it performs certain tasks in parallel which are done
       sequentially during the non-disruptive upgrade. Live-migrating guests to
       other &compnode;s during the non-disruptive
       upgrade takes additional time.
      </para>
      <para>
       Therefore, if a non-disruptive upgrade is not a requirement for you, you
       may want to switch to the normal upgrade mode, even if your setup
       supports the non-disruptive method. To force the normal upgrade mode,
       run:
      </para>
      <screen>&prompt.root;crowbarctl upgrade mode normal</screen>
      <para>
       To query the current upgrade mode run:
      </para>
      <screen>&prompt.root;crowbarctl upgrade mode</screen>
      <para>
       To switch back to the non-disruptive mode run:
      </para>
      <screen>&prompt.root;crowbarctl upgrade mode non_disruptive</screen>
      <para>
       It is possible to call this command at any time during the upgrade
       process until the <literal>services</literal> step is started. After
       that point the upgrade mode can no longer be changed.

     <para>
      To ensure the status of the nodes does not change during the upgrade
      process, the majority of the &ostack; services will be stopped on the
      nodes. As a result, the &ostack; API will no longer be
      accessible. The &vmguest;s, however, will continue to run and will also
      be accessible. Run the following command:
     </para>
     <screen>&prompt.root;crowbarctl upgrade services</screen>
     <para>
      This step takes a while to finish. Monitor the process by running
      <command>crowbarctl upgrade status</command>. Do not proceed before
      <literal>steps.services.status</literal> is set to
      <literal>passed</literal>.
     </para>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      The last step before upgrading the nodes is to make a backup of the
      &ostack; &postgres; database. The database dump will be stored on the
      &admserv; and can be used to restore the database in case something goes
      wrong during the upgrade.

     <screen>&prompt.root;crowbarctl upgrade backup openstack</screen>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      The final step of the upgrade procedure is upgrading the
      nodes.  To start the process, enter:
     </para>
     <screen>&prompt.root;crowbarctl upgrade nodes all</screen>
     <para>
      The upgrade process runs in the background and can be queried with
      <command>crowbarctl upgrade status</command>. Depending on the size of
      your &cloud; it may take several hours, especially when performing a
      non-disruptive update. In that case, the &compnode;s are updated
      one-by-one after &vmguest;s have been live-migrated to other nodes.
     </para>
     <para>
      Instead of upgrading all nodes you may also upgrade
      the &contrnode;s first and individual &compnode;s afterwards. Refer to
      <command>crowbarctl upgrade nodes --help</command> for details. If you
      choose this approach, you can use the <command>crowbarctl upgrade
      status</command> command to monitor the upgrade process. The output of
      this command contains the following entries:
     </para>
      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>

          </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Shows the current substep of the node upgrade step. For example,
            for the <command>crowbarctl upgrade nodes controllers</command>,
            the <literal>current_substep</literal> entry displays the
            <literal>controller_nodes</literal> status when upgrading controllers.

        </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
      </variablelist>
     <para>
       After the controllers have been upgraded, the
       <literal>steps.nodes.status</literal> entry in the output displays the
       <literal>running</literal> status. Check then the status of the
       <literal>current_substep_status</literal> entry. If it displays
       <literal>finished</literal>, you can move to the next step of upgrading
       the &compnode;s.

     <para>
      After the upgrade of compute nodes is postponed, you can go to &crow;

      they do not affect the &compnode;s. During the postponed upgrade, all

     <screen>&prompt.root;crowbarctl upgrade nodes resume</screen>

      And finish the upgrade with either <command>crowbarctl upgrade nodes

     If an error occurs during the upgrade process, the output of the

   After standard fencing has been performed, fence agent

   <systemitem>force_down</systemitem> API to notify it that the host is down.
   You should be able to see this in
   <filename>/var/log/nova/fence_compute.log</filename> on the node in the core
   cluster that was running the <systemitem>fence-nova</systemitem> agent at
   the time of fencing. During the recovery, <literal>fence_compute</literal>
   tells &o_comp; that the host is up and running again.

  <title>Bootstrapping the Compute Plane</title>
  <para>
   If the whole compute plane is down, it is not always obvious how to boot it
   up, because it can be subject to deadlock if evacuate attributes are set on
   every &compnode;. In this case, manual intervention is
   required. Specifically, the operator must manually choose one or more
   &compnode;s to bootstrap the compute plane, and then run the
   <command>attrd_updater -n evacuate -U no -N <replaceable>NODE</replaceable></command>
   command for each
   of those &compnode;s to indicate that they do not require the resurrection
   process and can have their <literal>nova-compute</literal> start up straight
   away. Once these &compnode;s are up, this breaks the deadlock allowing
   <literal>nova-evacuate</literal> to start. This way, any other nodes that
   require resurrection can be processed automatically. If no resurrection is
   desired anywhere in the cloud, then the attributes should be set to
   <literal>no</literal> for all nodes.
