 <title>Retrieving the SOS Report</title>
 <para>
  The SOS report provides debug level information about your environment to
  assist in troubleshooting issues. When troubleshooting and debugging issues
  in your &kw-hos; environment you can run an ansible playbook that will
  provide you with a full debug report, referred to as a SOS report. These
  reports can be sent to the support team when seeking assistance.
