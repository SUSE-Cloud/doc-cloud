 <title>Configuring the Required Distributed vSwitches and port groups</title>
  <para>
   The required Distributed vSwitches (DVS) and port groups can be created by
   using the vCenter graphical user interface (GUI) or by using command line
   tool provided by <literal>python-networking-vsphere</literal>. The vCenter
   GUI is recommended.

   OVSvApp virtual machines (VMs) give ESX installations the ability to
   leverage some of the advanced networking capabilities and other benefits
   &ostack; provides. In particular, OVSvApp allows for hosting VMs on ESX/ESXi
   hypervisors together with the flexibility of creating port groups
   dynamically on Distributed Virtual Switch.

   A port group is a management object for aggregation of multiple ports (on a
   virtual switch) under a common configuration. A VMware port group is used to
   group together a list of ports in a virtual switch (DVS in this section) so
   that they can be configured all at once. The member ports of a port group
   inherit their configuration from the port group, allowing for configuration
   of a port by simply dropping it into a predefined port group.

   The following sections cover
   configuring OVSvApp switches on ESX. More information about OVSvApp is
