  <title>Keeping the Nodes Up-to-date</title>

  <para>
   Keeping the nodes in &productname; up-to-date requires an appropriate
   setup of the update and pool repositories  and the deployment of
   either the <guimenu>Updater</guimenu> &barcl; or the &susemgr;
   &barcl;. For details, see
   <xref linkend="sec.depl.adm_conf.repos.scc"/>, <xref
   linkend="sec.depl.inst.nodes.post.updater"/>, and
   <xref linkend="sec.depl.inst.nodes.post.manager"/>.
 </para>

  <para>
   If one of those &barcl;s is deployed, patches are installed on the
   nodes. Installing patches that do not require a reboot of a node does not
   come with any service interruption. If a patch (for example, a kernel
   update) requires a reboot after the installation, services running on the
   machine that is rebooted will not be available within &cloud;.
   Therefore it is strongly recommended to install those patches during a
   maintenance window.
  </para>

   <title>No Maintenance Mode</title>

    As of &productname; &productnumber; it is not possible to put

      <title>Product Media Repository Copies</title>
      <para>
       To PXE boot new nodes, an additional &cloudos; repository&mdash;a copy
       of the installation syste&mdash; is required. Although not required
       during the upgrade procedure, it is recommended to set up this directory
       now. Refer to <xref linkend="sec.depl.adm_conf.repos.product"/> for
       details. If you had also copied the &productname; 6 installation media
       (optional), you may also want to provide the &productname;
       &productnumber; the same way.
      </para>
      <para>
       Once the upgrade procedure has been successfully finished, you may
       delete the previous copies of the installation media in
       <filename>/srv/tftpboot/suse-12.1/x86_64/install</filename> and
       <filename>/srv/tftpboot/suse-12.1/x86_64/repos/Cloud</filename>.

    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      To ensure the status of the nodes does not change during the upgrade
      process, the majority of the &ostack; services will be stopped on the
      nodes now. As a result, the &ostack; API will no longer be
      accessible. The &vmguest;s, however, will continue to run and will also
      be accessible. Run the following command:
     </para>
     <screen>crowbarctl upgrade services</screen>
     <para>
      This step takes a while to finish. Monitor the process by running
      <command>crowbarctl upgrade status</command>. Do not proceed before

      <literal>passed</literal>.
     </para>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      The last step before upgrading the nodes is to make a backup of the
      &ostack; &postgres; database. The database dump will be stored on the
      &admserv; and can be used to restore the database in case something goes
      wrong during the upgrade.

     <screen>crowbarctl upgrade backup openstack</screen>

    <step>

      The final step of the upgrade procedure is upgrading the
      nodes.  To start the process, enter:
     </para>
     <screen>crowbarctl upgrade nodes all</screen>
     <para>
      The upgrade process runs in the background and can be queried with
      <command>crowbarctl upgrade status</command>. Depending on the size of
      your &cloud; it may take several hours, especially when performing a
      non-disruptive update. In that case, the &compnode;s are updated
      one-by-one after &vmguest;s have been live-migrated to other nodes.
     </para>
     <para>
      Instead of upgrading <literal>all</literal> nodes you may also upgrade
      the &contrnode;s first and individual &compnode;s afterwards. Refer to
