  <title>Keeping the Nodes Up-To-Date</title>
  <para>
   Keeping the nodes in &productname; up-to-date requires an appropriate
   setup of the update and pool repositories and the deployment of
   either the <guimenu>Updater</guimenu> &barcl; or the &susemgr;
   &barcl;. For details, see
   <xref linkend="sec.depl.adm_conf.repos.scc"/>, <xref
   linkend="sec.depl.inst.nodes.post.updater"/>, and
   <xref linkend="sec.depl.inst.nodes.post.manager"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
   If one of those &barcl;s is deployed, patches are installed on the
   nodes. Patches that do not require a reboot will not cause a service
   interruption. If a patch (for example, a kernel update) requires a reboot
   after the installation, services running on the machine that is rebooted
   will not be available within &cloud;.  Therefore, we strongly recommend
   installing those patches during a maintenance window.
  </para>

  <note>
   <title>Maintenance Mode</title>
   <para>
    As of &productname; &productnumber;, it is not possible to put your entire
    &cloud; into <quote>Maintenance Mode</quote> (such as limiting all users to
    read-only operations on the control plane), as &ostack; does not support
    this. However when &pacemaker; is deployed to manage HA clusters, it should
    be used to place services and cluster nodes into <quote>Maintenance
    Mode</quote> before performing maintenance functions on them. For more
    information, see <link

       Stop chef-client services on the nodes, to prevent regular runs of

       <title>Testing Migration Procedure</title>
       <para>
        If you want to perform a dry run of the migration procedure, you can run the
       <command>psql2mysql migrate</command> without stopping the
       database-related &ostack; services. This way, if the test migration
       fails due to errors that weren't caught by the precheck procedure, you
       can fix them with &ostack; services still running, thus minimizing the
       required downtime. When you perform the actual migration, the data in
       the target databases will be replaced with the latest one in the source databases.
       </para>
       <para>
        After the test migration and before the actual migration, it is recommended to run the
        <command>psql2mysql purge-tables</command> command to purge tables in
        the target database. While this step is optional, it speeds up the
        migration process.

      <title>Forcing Normal Mode Upgrade</title>
      <para>
       The non-disruptive update will take longer than an upgrade in normal
       mode, because it performs certain tasks in parallel which are done
       sequentially during the non-disruptive upgrade. Live-migrating guests to
       other &compnode;s during the non-disruptive
       upgrade takes additional time.
      </para>
      <para>
       Therefore, if a non-disruptive upgrade is not a requirement for you, you
       may want to switch to the normal upgrade mode, even if your setup
       supports the non-disruptive method. To force the normal upgrade mode,
       run:
      </para>
      <screen>&prompt.root;crowbarctl upgrade mode normal</screen>
      <para>
       To query the current upgrade mode run:
      </para>

      </para>
      <screen>&prompt.root;crowbarctl upgrade mode non_disruptive</screen>
      <para>
       It is possible to call this command at any time during the upgrade
       process until the <literal>services</literal> step is started. After

       If the upgrade is done in normal mode (prechecks compute_status and

     <important>
      <title>Product Media Repository Copies</title>
      <para>
       To PXE boot new nodes, an additional &cloudos; repository&mdash;a copy
       of the installation system&mdash; is required. Although not required
       during the upgrade procedure, it is recommended to set up this directory
       now. Refer to <xref linkend="sec.depl.adm_conf.repos.product"/> for
       details. If you had also copied the &productname; 6 installation media
       (optional), you may also want to provide the &productname;
       &productnumber; the same way.
      </para>
      <para>
       Once the upgrade procedure has been successfully finished, you may
       delete the previous copies of the installation media in

    </step>

    <step>
     <para>
      To ensure the status of the nodes does not change during the upgrade
      process, the majority of the &ostack; services will be stopped on the
      nodes. As a result, the &ostack; API will no longer be
      accessible. The &vmguest;s, however, will continue to run and will also
      be accessible. Run the following command:
     </para>
     <screen>&prompt.root;crowbarctl upgrade services</screen>
     <para>
      This step takes a while to finish. Monitor the process by running
      <command>crowbarctl upgrade status</command>. Do not proceed before

      <literal>passed</literal>.
     </para>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      The last step before upgrading the nodes is to make a backup of the
      &ostack; &postgres; database. The database dump will be stored on the
      &admserv; and can be used to restore the database in case something goes
      wrong during the upgrade.

    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      The final step of the upgrade procedure is upgrading the
      nodes.  To start the process, enter:
     </para>
     <screen>&prompt.root;crowbarctl upgrade nodes all</screen>
     <para>
      The upgrade process runs in the background and can be queried with
      <command>crowbarctl upgrade status</command>. Depending on the size of
      your &cloud; it may take several hours, especially when performing a
      non-disruptive update. In that case, the &compnode;s are updated
      one-by-one after &vmguest;s have been live-migrated to other nodes.
     </para>
     <para>
      Instead of upgrading all nodes you may also upgrade
      the &contrnode;s first and individual &compnode;s afterwards. Refer to
      <command>crowbarctl upgrade nodes --help</command> for details. If you
      choose this approach, you can use the <command>crowbarctl upgrade
      status</command> command to monitor the upgrade process. The output of
      this command contains the following entries:
     </para>
      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>
            current_node_action
          </term>

          </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Shows the current substep of the node upgrade step. For example,
            for the <command>crowbarctl upgrade nodes controllers</command>,
            the <literal>current_substep</literal> entry displays the
            <literal>controller_nodes</literal> status when upgrading controllers.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
      </variablelist>
     <para>
       After the controllers have been upgraded, the
       <literal>steps.nodes.status</literal> entry in the output displays the
       <literal>running</literal> status. Check then the status of the
       <literal>current_substep_status</literal> entry. If it displays
       <literal>finished</literal>, you can move to the next step of upgrading
       the &compnode;s.

     <para>
      After the upgrade of compute nodes is postponed, you can go to &crow;

      they do not affect the &compnode;s. During the postponed upgrade, all
      &ostack; services should be up and running. &compnode;s are still
      running old version of services.

      To resume the upgrade, issue the command:
     </para>
     <screen>&prompt.root;crowbarctl upgrade nodes resume</screen>
     <para>
      And finish the upgrade with either <command>crowbarctl upgrade nodes

      upgrade nodes <replaceable>NODE_NAME</replaceable></command>.
     </para>
     <para>
       When upgrading individual &compnode;s using the <command>crowbarctl

   <title>Simultaneous Upgrade of Multiple Nodes</title>
   <para>
    It is possible to select more &compnode;s for selective upgrade instead of

   </para>
   <para>
    To upgrade multiple nodes simultaneously, use the following command:

   <para>
    Node names can be separated by comma, semicolon, or space. When using
    space as separator, put the part containing node names in quotes.

    Use the following command to find the names of the nodes that haven't been upgraded:
   </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;crowbarctl upgrade status nodes</screen>

    This means that it is not possible to pick an arbitrary number of

    that it is possible to live-migrate every instance away from the batch of
    nodes that are supposed to be upgraded in parallel. In case of high load
    on all &compnode;s, it might not be possible to upgrade more than one node
    at a time. Therefore, it is recommended to perform the following steps for
    each node targeted for the simultaneous upgrade prior to running the
    <command>crowbarctl upgrade nodes</command> command.
   </para>
   <procedure>
    <step>
     <para>
      Disable the &compnode; so it's not used as a target during
      live-evacuation of any other node:
     </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;openstack compute service set --disable <replaceable>"NODE_NAME"</replaceable> nova-compute</screen>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      Evacuate all running instances from the node:
     </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;nova host-evacuate-live <replaceable>"NODE_NAME"</replaceable></screen>
    </step>
   </procedure>
   <para>
    After completing these steps, you can perform a simultaneous upgrade of
    the selected nodes.

        Node upgrade has failed during live migration.
       </para>
      </question>
      <answer>
       <para>
        The problem may occur when it is not possible to live migrate certain
        VMs anywhere. It may be necessary to shut down or suspend other VMs to
        make room for migration. Note that the Bash shell script that starts
        the live migration for the &compnode; is executed from the
        &contrnode;. An error message generated by the <command>crowbarctl
        upgrade status</command> command contains the exact names of both
        nodes. Check the <filename>/var/log/crowbar/node-upgrade.log</filename>
        file on the &contrnode; for the information that can help you with
        troubleshooting. You might also need to check &ostack-bare; logs in
        <filename>/var/log/nova</filename> on the &compnode; as well as on the
        &contrnode;s.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is possible that live-migration of a certain VM takes too long. This
        can happen if instances are very large or network connection between
        compute hosts is slow or overloaded. If this case, try to raise the
        global timeout in
        <filename>/etc/crowbar/upgrade_timeouts.yml</filename>.
       </para>
       <para>
        We recommend to perform the live migration manually first. After it is
        completed successfully, call the <command>crowbarctl upgrade</command>
        command again.
       </para>
       <para>
        The following commands can be helpful for analyzing issues with live migrations:

        nova server-migration-show
        nova instance-action-list

       </para>

         <para>
          <filename>/var/log/nova/nova-compute</filename> on the &compnode;s

         </para>
        </listitem>
       </itemizedlist>
       <para>
        It can happen that active instances and instances with heavy
        loads cannot be live migrated in a reasonable time. In that case, you
        can abort a running live-migration operation using the <command>nova
        live-migration-abort <replaceable>MIGRATION-ID</replaceable></command>
        command. You can then perform the upgrade of the specific node at a
        later time.
       </para>
       <para>
        Alternatively, it is possible to force the completion of
        the live migration by using the <command>nova
        live-migration-force-complete
        <replaceable>MIGRATION-ID</replaceable></command> command. However,
        this might pause the instances for a prolonged period of time and have
        a negative impact on the workload running inside the instance.

        Possible reasons include an incorrect repository setup or package

        available. To test the setup, install a package manually or run the
        <command>zypper dup</command> command (this command is executed by the
        upgrade script). Fix the repository setup and run the failed upgrade
        step again. If custom package versions or version locks are in place,

   If the whole compute plane is down, it is not always obvious how to boot it

   &compnode;s to bootstrap the compute plane, and then run the
