    <title>Removing Former Key Pairs</title>
    <para>After an instance has once been launched with a certain key pair (that is injected into the
     respective image by <filename>cloud-init</filename> during start), the key pair will stick to
     that instance. Unless you remove the former key pair from the instance it is 
     impossible to restart the instance with a different key pair than the original one. This is also
     true for snapshots taken from an instance. </para>
    <para>Run the following command within the instance to remove the former data (for example, to
     prepare an instance for a snapshot):</para>
    <screen>rm -rf /var/lib/cloud/instances/*</screen>
    <para>After the clean-up, a new key pair can be injected into the instance
    (or an instance started from a snapshot) during boot time.</para>
    <para>To change key pairs on a running instance, access the instance via SSH and replace the
     respective key by editing the file 
      <filename>/root/.ssh/authorized_keys</filename>.</para>

   <para>Technically, an instance snapshot is an image, too,

      difference compared to an image that has been directly uploaded to

   <title>VLAN Settings</title>
   <para>
    As of &productname; &productnumber;, using a VLAN for the admin network is
    only supported on a native/untagged VLAN. If you need VLAN support for the
    admin network, it must be handled at switch level.
   </para>

    When changing the network configuration with &yast; or by editing

   <para>
    <emphasis role="bold">nova-fixed</emphasis>: The <guimenu>USE VLAN</guimenu>
    setting will be ignored. However, VLANs will automatically be used if
    deploying &o_netw; with VLAN support (using the plugins linuxbridge,
    openvswitch plus VLAN or cisco plus VLAN). In this case, you need to specify
    a correct <guimenu>VLAN ID</guimenu> for this
    network.

    needs to use a different physical network interface than the
